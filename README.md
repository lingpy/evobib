# EvoBib: A Bibliographic Database and Quote Collection

EvoBib is a collection of bibliographic entries and quotes. If you want to simply access the most recent version of the data, just download the files `evobib-converted.bib` and `evoref.csv` which contain the data in the most recent dumps (the original file `evobib.bib` contains many customized entries that may not work). 

You can also access the most recent version of the the bibliography directly via its URL, thus when writing [http://evobib.digling.org/evobib.py?key=Swadesh1955&display=bibtex](http://evobib.digling.org/evobib.py?key=Swadesh1955&display=bibtex), you will receive:
