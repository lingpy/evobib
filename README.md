# EvoBib: A Bibliographic Database and Quote Collection

EvoBib is a collection of bibliographic entries and quotes. If you want to simply access the most recent version of the data, just download the files `evobib-converted.bib` and `evoref.csv` which contain the data in the most recent dumps (the original file `evobib.bib` contains many customized entries that may not work). 

You can also access the most recent version of the the bibliography directly via its URL, thus when writing [http://bibliography.lingpy.org/evobib.py?key=Swadesh1955&display=bibtex](http://bibliography.lingpy.org/evobib.py?key=Swadesh1955&display=bibtex), you will receive:

```
@article{Swadesh1955,
    author = {Swadesh, Morris},
    journal = {International Journal of American Linguistics},
    number = {2},
    pages = {121-137},
    title = {Towards greater accuracy in lexicostatistic dating},
    volume = {21},
    year = {1955}
}
```

In order to explore the data in a "normal" mode, just go to the main interface at [http://bibliography.lingpy.org](http://bibliography.lingpy.org).
