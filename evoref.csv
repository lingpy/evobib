Harrison2003,"Comparative historical linguists have been rather more careful in
stipulating what it means for linguistic symbols to be similar in form. Observe
first that similarity of form must be *complete* similarity. Put rather
brutally, if the front halves of two forms are similar, but the back halves
aren't, then the forms are not similar. In practice, we observe this condition
by segmenting each form into its component (segmental or autosegmental) parts,
and then mapping the segmented forms into a set of *correspondences*
between a part or parts of one form and a part or parts (possibly nil) of the
other. We need not go into the mechanics of that segmentation process here. The

Sapir1921,"Are there resistances of a more intimate nature to the borrowing of words? It is
generally assumed that the nature and extent of borrowing depend entirely on the
historical facts of culture relation; that if German, for instance, has borrowed less
copiously than English from Latin and French it is only because Germany has had less
intimate relations than England with the culture spheres of classical Rome and France.
This is true to a considerable extent, but it is not the whole truth. We must not
exaggerate the physical importance of the Norman invasion nor underrate the
significance of the fact that Germany’s central geographical position made it peculiarly
sensitive to French influences all through the Middle Ages, to humanistic influences in
the latter fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, and again to the powerful French
influences of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It seems very probable that the
psychological attitude of the borrowing language itself towards linguistic material has
much to do with its receptivity to foreign words. English has long been striving for the
completely unified, unanalyzed word, regardless of whether it is monosyllabic or
polysyllabic. Such words as credible, certitude, intangible are entirely welcome in
English because each represents a unitary, well-nuanced idea and because their formal
analysis (cred-ible, certitude, in-tang-ible) is not a necessary act of the unconscious
mind (cred-, cert-, and tang- have no real existence in English comparable to that of
good- in goodness). A word like intangible, once it is acclimated, is nearly as simple a
psychological entity as any radical monosyllable (say vague, thin, grasp). In German,
however, polysyllabic words strive to analyze themselves into significant elements.
Hence vast numbers of French and Latin words, borrowed at the height of certain
cultural influences, could not maintain themselves in the language. Latin-German
words like kredibel “credible” and French-German words like reussieren “to succeed”
offered nothing that the unconscious mind could assimilate to its customary method of
feeling and handling words. It is as though this unconscious mind said: “I am perfectly
willing to accept kredibel if you will just tell me what you mean by kred-.” Hence
German has generally found it easier to create new words out of its own resources, as
the necessity for them arose.","lexical borrowing, borrowing constraints"

nomi diversi le stesse leggende, gli stessi miti, le stesse divinità, le stesse

siano esclusi, di fronte alla concordanza di due o più lingue indoeuropee contro
le altre resta sempre la possibilità che le rimanenti lingue abbiano perduto il

[Very rarely are we sure of isoglosses that we construct, and this
for several reasons. When dealing with phonetical phenomena, we observe
identical facts that developed spontaneously and independently in the
territories very distant from each other and without contact between them (like
the German and Armenian Lautverschiebung); this happens because the
physiological organs that produce the sounds are more or less the same in all
the races, and therefore the sounds and their transformations are limited
regarding their number and are pronounced in very various times and places. When
dealing with morphological phenomena, the same, which has been just said, holds.
But in most cases we can observe common develop[pb]ments; because the
psychological laws resemble each other under every sky, and under every sky we
find with various names the same legends, the same myths, the same divinity, the
same fables, with a nearly tedious monotony (1). But also when these factors are
excluded, opposed to an agreement of two or more Indo-European languages with
another one, there always remains the possibility that the remaining languages
have lost the sound, the form, or the word one is dealing with; and it is
generally difficult to demonstrate the contrary (2). This happens because the
laws of linguistic change are still substantially unknown today, and we shall
only be able to discover them, if we accumulate and order every linguistical
material that allows us to draw conclusions from the truth of the things and
avoid to impose our abstractions on them.]","isoglosses, contact-induced similarity, genetic similarity"

Francois2008,"Even though this may fail to represent faithfully the language-internal
perception of an English native speaker, at least this serves efficiently the
purpose of cross-linguistic comparison: it becomes then easy to state the facts
by saying that these two senses are treated the same in English, and not in
French. ",vagueness
Francois2008,"This empirical method of defining senses based on cross-linguistic
comparison has the valuable advantage that it helps “sidestep the vexing problem
of distinguishing between polysemy and vagueness” (Haspelmath 2003: 231). ",vagueness
Francois2008," For example, Brown (2005a) suggests that the colexification of 〈hand〉 –
〈arm〉 may be influenced by the geographical situation of the community.
According to him, the use of “tailored clothing covering the arm” in colder
environments tends to make the contrast between the hand and the arm more
salient, thus favoring the existence of two separate lexical items.",colexification

convergence, from genetic inheritance, or from contact-induced change ... just
like any other structural feature of a language.",colexification
Francois2008,"The method suggested by Haspelmath indeed resorts to observable data from
actual languages. The basic idea is that senses should be arranged in space in
such a way that each lexical unit in one language “occupies a contiguous area on
the seman- tic map” (2003:  216). Furthermore, each specific connecting line
should reflect the existence of at least one attested case of a direct lexical
connection between these two senses, in any of the world’s languages.","networks, colexification, polysemy"

Allen1953,"The systematization of similarities presupposes the identification of
comparable items; and in traditional comparative linguistics the criteria for
such identification are mainly of one type. The upper limit for the item is the
word, more often the [pb] morpheme; and the comparable items in two or more
languages are identified on a combined formal and semantic basis -- the
\`\`linguistic meaning form"" as one writer has called it (`cf. Dyen 1951 <browse/Dyen1951>`_).
for analytical purposes these two aspects of the identification may here be
considered one at a time. The semantic identification is by translation into
some common language -- the \`language of reference' we may term it; if the
translations of the two or more items are identical, then the identification is
accepted without question; if they are not, the identification depends largely
upon the intuition or the preconceptions of the scholar concerned.
Identifications of the latter type are not infrequently \`\`supported"" by the
citation of appropriate aphorism from the system of rhetoric entitled by its
Greek authors Περὶ Τρόπων and by its modern exponents \`\`Semantic
Changes"" -- a mode of support which has been expressly condemned by Meillet 
(`Meillet: Méthode comparative <browse/Meillet1925>`_). ","semantic similarity"
Allen1953,"[...] only those semantic equations are therefore considered for which
it proves possible to state a corresponding formal equation: and the criterion
for such an equation is that the correspondences between its terms should be
congruent with those set up for other acceptable equations. It is precisely
the insistence upon and possibility of stating these systematic correspondences
that has given comparative linguistics its special character and puts the
formal identifications on a more favourable footing than the semantic
identifications. The formal correspondences are stated monosystematically in
what are, to all intents and purposes, phonemic terms -- it is to be noted that
we in fact owe the term \`\`phoneme"" to Kruszewski's comparative-historical
studies of morphemic alternation (`Kazan 1881: Über die Lautabwechslung <browse/Kazan1881>`_,
`Firth: Firth, J. R. (1934) The word “Phoneme”, Le Maître phonétique 46:
44–6 <browse/Firth1934>`_) the Roman and romanized orthographies of much of the comparative
material [pb] were already all but phonemic, so that little work upon them was
necessary in order to make a beginning, but only a study, as Hjelmslev has
pointed out, of *literarum permutationes* [!??!].
By the formal criterion, then, Lat. *ovis* and Skt. *avi\d{h}}*
\`\`sheep"", for example, are accepted as comparable, in that they are
identifiable phoneme by phoneme in accordance with the established system of
correspondences, to which they themselves add support; by the same criterion
an identification of Lat. *manus* and Skt. *hasta\d{h}* \`\`hand"", is
rejected. Thus only those examples are admitted to comparison for which a
correspondence-system can be established -- in other words, from the point of
view of such a system, only corroborative items are selected. From this it
would appear that the regularity of the \`\`sound-laws"" was not so much a blind
as a logical necessity. ","formal similarities"

of a sign is changed on the model of a cognate in a language in contact,
without effect on the content.",-

phrase are adapted to word-formative or syntactic patterns of the recipient
language (if the elements are transferred unanalyzed, the word is to be
considered simple).","loan transfer"

Weinreich1974,"Only the most concrete loanwords, such as designations for newly invented or imported objects, can be thought of as mere additions to the vocabulary. ","loanword integration"
Weinreich1974,"Except for loanwords with entirely new content, the transfer or reproduction of foreign words must affect the existing vocabulary in one of three ways: (1) confusion between the content of the new and old word; (2) disappearance of the old words; (3) survival of both the new and old word, with a specialisation in content.","loanword integration"

Weinreich1974,"Another internal factor cunducive to lexical innovation is perniciou7s HOMONYMY. [pb] [...] the explanation by homonymy must nevertheless be applied to the behavior of bilinguals only with great care, for in many cases the existence of homonyms has definitely not prevented borrowing.",homonymy
Weinreich1974,"A third reason for lexical innovation is related to the well-known tendency of affective words to lose their expressive force. [...
 In such semantic fields as `talking', `beating', `sleeping', `tallness', or `ugliness', there is in may languages a constant NEED FOR SYNONYMS, on onomastic low-pressure areas, as it were.","lexical borrowing"
Weinreich1974,"Wheras the unilingual depends in replenishing his vocabulary, on indigenous lexical material and whatever loanwords may happen to be transmitted to him, the BILINGUAL has the other language as a constantly available source of lexical innovations.","bilingualism, lexical borrowing"
Weinreich1974,"Three additional factors may prompt lexical borrowing on the part of
bilinguals. First, a comparison with the other language to which he is exposed
may lead him to feel that some of his semantic fields are INSUFFICIENTLY DIFFERENTIATED.","bilingualism, lexical borrowing"
Weinreich1974,"A second consideration affecting bilinguals in particular is the symbolic
association of the source language in a contact situation with SOCIAL VALUES,
either positive or negative.","lexical borrowing"
Weinreich1974,"Finally, a bilingual's speech may suffer from the interference of another vocabulary through mere OVERSIGHT; that is, the limitations on the distribution of certain words to utterances belonging to one language are violated.","lexical borrowing"
Weinreich1974,"Yet, remarkably, some words seem never to be transferred. [...] This resistance to transfer on the part of some words has so far not received any explanation. It is one of the unsolved problems of language contact.","borrowing constraints"
Weinreich1974,"In a specific instance, an existing word in the recipient language might be supposed to repel a homophonous transfer; to avoid homonymy, loan translation, (or semantic extension) might be preferred.","borrowing constraints, homonymy"
Weinreich1974,"Theoretically, too, a language with many restrictions on the form of words may be proportionately more resistant to outright transfer and favor semantic extensions and loan translation instead. Such resistance would, of course, be a function not of the structure of the recipient language, but of the difference in the structures of the recipient and source languages. If Tibetan resisted transfers from Sanskrit and restricted its borrowing to loan translations, it was only because the strucutre of Sanskrit words was so different from its own structure; the resistance to transfers from a language with more congenial word structure, like Chinese, has not been so great.","borrowing constraints"
Taub1993,"For example, in Zur vergleichende Sprachengeschichte (1848) he suggested that languages are natural organisms because, like plants and animals, they can be grouped into families; such a system of classification can be used to describe the relationships between languages.","biological parallels, August Schleicher, organism"

Taub1993,"He had studied at Bonn with Friedrich Ritschl (1806-76), an important figure in the field of textual criticism. While Ritsch had not invented the method of recovering a lost manuscript source or archetype, he emphasized the procedure and rules by which manuscripts, both extant and reconstructed versions, are placed in a pedigree or stemma. One of the most important doctrines of this method is that of the shared error, which served as a criterion in setting-up subfamilies in a manuscript tradition. The established way to represent relationships between various manuscripts was the genealogical tree, or stemma; the branches, symbolizing events in time, represented the [pb] origin, by copying, of manuscript from manuscript source (either extant or inferred). The \`method' as applied and refined by a great many scholars, remained an important aspect of textual criticism. Though one might be tempted to suggest that Schleicher got the idea for hist *Stammbaum* from natural history and taxonomy, it seems just as likely that the impetus came from Ritschl's method, a method which bears important similarities to Schleicher's own method of linguistic reconstruction.","stemmatics, August Schleicher"
Taub1993,"Schleicher suggested that he was himself a pracitioner of the uniformitarian doctrine of Lyell, explaining that he had always believed that languages change very gradually, according to definite laws which limit variation.

Taub1993,"Affirming his own commitment to \`Baconian' principles, Schleicher was very confident of the ability of his method to describe the real development of language, and made strong claims regarding the ability of philologists to study linguistic change, arguing that philologists \`know positively from the observation of collected facts that languages change as long as they live'. Schleicher recognized, but did not question, the possibility that facts might not have a perfect fit with theory; he included a *Stammbaum* in his book as an illustration of the genealogical relationships bewteen languages, warning that \`in comparing this with Darwin's diagram, one should not forget that the author of the \`\`Origin of Species"" had to draw up an ideal scheme, wheras we have represented the actual process of development of a given family'.","family tree, biological parallels, August Schleicher"

Alvarez-Ponce2013,"Problematically, phylogenetic tree reconstruction is particularly challenging in the presence of highly divergent sequences (26, 34). First, it relies on gene families delimited using clustering methods such as the Markov cluster algorithm (35), which detects communities of closely related sequences from BLAST results. This approach may exclude the most divergent homologs in a family, which might be the most informative for an event as ancient as the origin of Eukaryotes. Second, multiple sequence alignments cannot be accurately constructed in the presence of a high number of substitutions. Third, long divergence times may have eroded at least part of the phylogenetic signal, or even deleted any detectable similarity between homologous sequences (34). Finally, generating phylogenetic hypotheses using very divergent sequences is very dependent on the model of sequence evolution used (e.g., ref. 36), and in practice highly divergent sequences almost always produce highly questionable placements in phylogenetic trees. Therefore, it is desirable to explore whether new data types exist that might provide new insight into deep evolutionary events.","sequence comparison, phylogenetic tree"
Alvarez-Ponce2013,"As an alternative to phylogenetic trees, the relationships among genes can be represented more generally in the form of gene similarity networks, in which nodes and edges represent genes and similarity statements (e.g., BLAST hits), respectively (37–43).","gene similarity network"
Alvarez-Ponce2013,"By considering indirect relationships, gene similarity networks have the potential to explore deeper relationships than phylogenetic trees, thus being particularly appropriate for exploring deep evolutionary events such as the origin of Eukaryotes.",-
Bapteste2012,"Indeed, many genetic similarities between biological objects are not caused by vertical descent, where the genetic material of a particular entity is propagated by replication inside its own lineage.",-
Bapteste2012,"For instance, adaptive lateral genetic transfer between genomes of entities from different lineages that share the same environment or lifestyle (29, 32, 46) indicates additional (non-vertical) mechanisms for the integration of genetic material into one host. Hence, another type of descent is fundamental to the reconstruction of an accurate evolutionary picture of the evolutionary units.",-
Bapteste2012,"The typical biological outcomes of these interlineage and interlevel assortments, namely the mosaic objects, and the multilineage coalitions of genetic partners involved in these processes can be stabilized and selected, becoming important evolutionary players in their own right (46). Therefore, introgressive descent generates non-genealogical bonds between biological objects, producing a reticulate evolutionary framework.","mosaic history"
Bapteste2012,"This range has two extremes. First, there are mergers. Mergers arise when two or more components, not hitherto coexisting within the same unit, are brought together, and these components are subsequently replicated or propagated within or by a new single corporate body (9). [...] Fused genes conferring drug resistance (35), new viral genomes (49), lineages treated from symbioses (39, 56), and Russian dolls of mobile genetic elements 52, 53) are among the best known examples of mergers. The offspring of sexual eproduction are also obligate mergers, because their parts come from distinct — although closely related—sources (two parents instead of one last common ancestor).","introgressive descent"
Bapteste2012,"Second, there are multilineage clubs. Members of these clubs form coalitions of entities that replicate in separate events and exploit some common genetic material that does not trace back to a single locus in a single last common ancestor of all of the members (26, 29, 31, 32, 57, 58).",-
Bapteste2012,"For instance, gene networks represent sequences by nodes, and these nodes are connected by edges when they manifest significant similarity (63). Genome networks represent genomes as nodes, and these nodes are connected by edges when they share common features (e.g., the same sequence or the same gene family) (47–49).","genome networks, gene networks"
Bapteste2012,"In genome networks, monophyletic groups will generally produce cliques (Figs. 1 and 2A and Table 1) (i.e., subgraphs in which all nodes are directly connected to one another), because all entities under study share some coalescent orthologs. However, when the similarity of characters decreases under a given threshold through evolution, a different pattern is produced: some edges disappear, and cliques are replaced by intransitive chains, with adjacent objects of the chain presenting similarity up to a certain threshold (Fig. 2B). In agreement with the terminology of graph theory, we call such a subgraph of three nodes (A, B, and C) a P3 (64), where A is linked to B, B is linked to C, and A is not linked to C. This concept can be easily extended to the case where A, B, and C are not nodes but instead, cliques; in graph theory, B is called a minimal clique separator (65).","clique, network, genome networks"
Bapteste2012,"By contrast, we call mosaic-P3 (M-P3) a P3, in which two entities, A and C, are indirectly connected through a third entity, B, by one or more characters that are not coalescent orthologs (Fig. 2C). Such an M-P3 unites at least two distantly related and/or unrelated lineages through a third entity acting as an intermediate binder. By definition, this structure is beyond the reach of a single-tree analysis; A and C cannot be compared directly, because they lack homology for the traits under study.",-
Bapteste2012a,"One strategy to handle massive amounts of unknowns and an overwhelming wealth of data is called exploratory studies. Such studies go from (microbiome) data to hypotheses and rely heavily on the experimental design of most inclusive methods of genetic diversity, which seek for patterns in huge data sets with the fewest assumptions possible to ease the  discovery of unrecognized regularities, phenomena and interactions. The assumed goal of exploratory studies is to foster the discovery of many unrecognized patterns and to actively generate novel hypotheses, in our case about genetic diversity [2].","exploratory data analysis"

Bapteste2012a,"For instance, in genome networks, two nodes (genomes) are connected when they share at least a gene family (i.e. two genomes of Escherichia coli, each with a copy of a glucose dehydrogenase, will be connected). In gene networks [5], two nodes (individual sequences) are connected when they display more than a certain threshold of similarity (i.e. two glucose dehydrogenases will be connected when their reciprocal best BLAST score is :math:`< 1e-5` and/or when they display :math:`> 70%` sequence identity).","gene networks, genome networks"
Bapteste2013,"Evolutionary networks today are most often used for population genetics, investigating hybridization in plants, or the lateral transmission of genes, especially in viruses and prokaryotes. However, the more we learn about genomes the less tree-like we find their evolutionary history to be, both in terms of the genetic components of species and occasionally of the species themselves.","phylogenetic network"
Bapteste2013,"A wide variety of evolutionary processes lead to mosaic patterns of relationships among taxa: sex in eukaryotes, recombination in its variety of forms, gene conversion between paralogs, intron retrohoming, allopolyploidization, partial non-orthologous replacement, the selection of new genetic assemblages leading to modular entities as in operon formation, the emergence of new families of transposons, independent lineage-sorting among alleles, and unequal rates of character loss between lineages, among others (Table 1).","mosaic history, phylogenetic network"

Wang1996,"A third approach I would like to discuss briefly has to do with the internal temporal relations among the linguistics changes. The importance of studying these relations has been captured in the remarks of Ting Panghsin 丁邦新, who proposes to base the larger groupings of dialects on earlier changes, and smaller groupings on later changes. ","Chinese dialectology, genetic classification"
Wang1997,"A major justification for calling all these seven varieties dialects is the great amount of socio-cultural continuity and homogeneity that is reflected in them for many centuries.","Chinese dialectology"
Wang1997,"This continuity and homogeneity is probably more accelerated today than ever before, since virtually everyone in China speaks Putonghua to some extent . This situation serves as a powerful centripetal force that is constantly feeding lexical items and grammatical features from Putonghua into all varieties of Chinese.

Wang1997,"Furthermore, the traditionalist would point out, that the shared written language is another strong argument. The design of the writing system is such that a group of characters which share a phonetic component have identical or similar pronunciations to each other . But the value of the phonetic component itself has no fixed phonetic value and varies according to space and time. This is the feature that made the characters serviceable to such a large population over these many centuries.","centripetal forces, Chinese dialectology, language history"
Wang1997,"To balance out the picture, however, we should note that the characters which come from the political center are often not completely adequate to meet regional needs. Speaking from a Min viewpoint, R. Cheng put the point across well when he wrote an article entitled ""Taiwanese morphemes in search of Chinese characters.""

such as that in Wurm et al. (1988) and Lï Róng (1989), may not be
valid from a phylogenetic point of view. If Mandarin is defined
broadly enough to include Rúgāo, then it is probably broad enough
(from a phonological point of view, at least) to include Chángshà and
Hángzhōu. If we use a narrower definition of Mandarin which would
exclude Changshà and Hangzhôu, it would probably exclude Rúgāo
as well. If Chángshà and Hángzhōu really are descendants of
Proto-Macro-Mandarin, then this raises the question whether the
other dialects now assigned to the Xiāng and Wú groups are also
derivable from it; if not, then Xiāng and Wú as currently defined may
not be valid phylogenetic units.","Xiāng, Wú, Chinese, Mandarin, dialect classification"

innovations which affect some dialects but not others; the resulting

pattern of shared innovations among the dialects. If a dialect
classification is based on a small number of features, the job of
identifying shared innovations is not especially complex and can be
done by hand. But given the fact that the same change may happen
repeatedly by chance, or may spread from one dialect to another, it is
questionable whether any classification based on only a few features
will be phylogenetically meaningful.","homoplasy, dialect classification, inheritance, shared innovation, borrowing"

frequently found in languages all over the world, and the subsequent
merger of [tç] with [ts] in the same environment is also a very natural [pb] change; moreover, since this merger is a feature of standard

Baxter2006a,"One final question: Is it appropriate to use phonology as a
basis for phylogeny? I chose to use phonological mergers in this
study largely because we can usually say with confidence that the
unmerged state is the ancestral one, and the merged state is the
innovative one. But as noted above, some phonological innovations
are natural and may occur many times independently; and some
innovations (not necessarily the same ones) are easily imitated, and
likely to spread across dialect boundaries, if the sociolinguistic
conditions are right. In either case, the innovations are unlikely to be
useful in inferring phylogeny.","Chinese, dialect classification, genetic classification, classification criteria"
Baxter2006a,"On the other hand, phonological innovations which are
subtle and unusual are less likely to recur independently or to be
successfully imitated by speakers of neighboring dialects. In the
Chinese context, a dialect can easily lose the distinction between
retroflex and dental sibilants ([t§] etc. and [ts] etc.) across the board;
but dialects which have the distinction show several subtly different
patterns (see the discussion in Baxter (1999)), which would probably
be difficult for outsiders to imitate successfully. The innovations
which produced these patterns are therefore potentially useful for
inferring phylogeny. In any case, a classification based on a large
number of phonological innovations is more likely to reflect
phylogeny than traditional classifications based on a few arbitrarily
chosen features, some of which are innovations and some of which
are not","dialect classification, Chinese, genetic classification, classification criteria, subgrouping"

The data has shown, among other things, that northern dialects have fewer tones and higher pitch values than southern dialects, that high tones predominate in most dialects, and that the falling tone contour occurs more frequently than any other tonal contour.

dialects may change gradually along a continuum from one
locality to another, therefore showing no boundaries. People
speak of ""Guanhua"", ""Wu"" and so on, but there is no such thing,
what really exists is the dialect of each speech community, and
ultimately an idiolect. Or we can safely say that the only
existence is the linguistic features which are shared by the
particular dialects. On the other hand, it is equally evident that
we witness bundles of isoglosses dividing particular regions and
we can say these are boundaries. This has been exemplified by
such works as Zavjalova (1983) and numerous works devoted to
the atlas, ""LANGUAGE ATLAS OF CHINA"" (LAC).","isoglosses, dialect classification, Chinese dialectology"

most of the forms, in Shangdong, Henan, Hebei and north

Wu2005,"This is the first book in Chinese linguistics which discusses the grammar of a dialect group, in this case the Xiang dialect spoken in Hunan, from both a synchronic and diachronic prespective. The author uses new data and new frameworks to present her analysis. The synchronic part covers contemporary grammar across localities within the Xiang-speaking area by using the methods and theories of comparative and typological linguistics. The diachronic analysis reconstructs earlier grammatical systems based mainly on modern data but also on historical written records, and analyses the development of the syntactic systems of the Xiang dialects, adopting the methods and theories of historical linguistics and grammaticalization.

The discussions in this book raise new issues on dialect research which have not yet been fully acknowledged by Chinese dialectologists. The author shows, for example, how the earlier layers of grammar may be reconstructed on the basis of modern data, and how the path of grammaticalization of functional words may be traced. The discussions reveal that the Xiang dialect group forms a transitional zone between northern and southern dialects. The syntactic constructions in these two areas often co-exist or are mingled in Xiang. Thus, the grammatical constructions in different localities of the Xiang dialect group often provide a bridge connecting the constructions of northern and southern Chinese, or Modern Chinese and Chinese of earlier periods.

As background, she sketches the development and current state of Chinese dialectology and dialect research. One of the author's aims is to show respect for the grand achievement the Dictionary undoubtedly is, but also to emphasize a critical distance to some of the views presented in it.

Apart from being an analysis of this particular Dictionary, the book presents data about the state of modern Chinese dialectology.

Looking at Chinese dialectology from a Western point of view, the author aims to understand and present the Chinese perspective.

The book fills an important gap in the field of Western sinology.

Furthermore, eukaryotic genes highly connected to prokaryotic
genes from one domain tend not to be connected to genes from
the other prokaryotic domain. Genes of archaebacterial and eubac-

different subcellular compartments, but in such an intertwined
way that suggests an early rather than late integration of both
gene repertoires. The archaebacterial repertoire has a similar size
in all eukaryotic genomes whereas the number of eubacterium-
derived genes is much more variable, suggesting a higher plasticity
of this gene repertoire. Consequently, highly reduced eukaryotic
genomes contain more genes of archaebacterial than eubacterial af-

However, many other kinds of processes contribute to evolutionary diversity. In vertical descent, the genetic material of a particular
evolutionary unit is propagated by replication inside its own lineage. In what we call introgressive descent, the genetic material of
a particular evolutionary unit propagates into different host structures and is replicated within these host structures. Thus, introgressive
descent generates a variety of evolutionary units and leaves recognizable patterns in resemblance networks. We characterize six kinds of
evolutionary units, of which five involve mosaic lineages generated by introgressive descent. To facilitate detection of these units in
resemblance networks, we introduce terminology based on two notions, P3s (subgraphs of three nodes: A, B, and C) and mosaic P3s, and
suggest an apparatus for systematic detection of introgressive descent. Mosaic P3s correspond to a distinct type of evolutionary bond that
is orthogonal to the bonds of kinship and genealogy usually examined by evolutionary biologists. We argue that recognition of these
evolutionary bonds stimulates radical rethinking of key questions in evolutionary biology (e.g., the relations among evolutionary players
in very early phases of evolutionary history, the origin and emergence of novelties, and the production of new lineages). This line of
research will expand the study of biological complexity beyond the usual genealogical bonds, revealing additional sources of biodiversity.

findings: 1) The distribution of modern dialects is well accounted for in terms of “Northernization” and

unbiased by historical documents; 3) The development of stress accent in Northern dialects has caused
some word groups to acquire grammatical elements in their forms, due to the function of analogical
attraction; 4) Any word can be in collision with others due to internal and external factors. Chinese cases
are explained in terms of homonymic and synonymic collisions.","dialect geography, Chinese, Chinese dialects "
Iwata2010,"In China, on the other hand, linguistic geography ceased to exist after 1948.
Meanwhile, mainstream linguistic study was directed toward two purposes: one, to
reconstruct ancient Chinese phonology, and the other, to classify its dialects and
demarcate their respective areas of distribution. While the current international trend in
geolinguistics is to utilize dialect resources via computer-based GIS, we researchers in
the Chinese field still have enough reasons for emphasizing the necessity of applying
this classical method, linguistic geography, to the study of Chinese languages

Iwata2010,"A contribution of Bernhard Karlgren (1889-1978) was to treat “Modern Sounds”
(his “Ancient Chinese”) as a reference point for studying the whole history of Chinese;
namely studying “Old Sounds” (his “Archaic Chinese”) in terms of the projection from
Ancient Chinese. This approach was much like that of the Qing Philologists, while
unlike the Chinese precursors, this explained the phonetic forms of modern dialects as
reflexes of Ancient Chinese. In his masterpiece, Études sur la phonologie chinoise
(1915-1926), he reconstructed the sound system of Ancient Chinese, based on his own
survey of twenty-four dialects, thus establishing his comparative method. For this

Iwata2010,"Northernization of the Southern dialects could not have been accomplished
simply by the southern movement of population. There are two views we consider
common sense but which are not shared by most Chinese dialectologists. One regards
the effect of migration on the subsequent development of the host dialects. Based on
historical documents, scholars in the Chinese field have interpreted dialect distribution
in terms of migration. However, evidence shows that the language of immigrants has a
tencency to assimilate to the host dialect and will basically fade away after three
generations, if the immigration is to the village of Han Chinese inhabitants (Iwata
2007a: 125).","migration, language history"
Iwata2010,"The second piece of common sense for us is the fact that *words could travel by
walking*, instead of flying from one place to another by migration. This is to say, the
most prevalent medium for dialect diffusion or transmission should have been daily
communication of farmers living in one village with those in another, therefore it should
have taken a long time for one word to move from one place to another. In Chinese
dialectology, however, this view has been least recognized by researchers due to their
overestimation of the factor of migration (Iwata 1995: 222-223).","linguistic diffusion, lexical diffusion, Chinese"

cities around its southern border: Nanjing and Yangzhou. Nanjing was established as
the Southern capital during the era of the Six Dynasty (222-589 AD.), and through to
the 20 th Century it performed the role of political center for the whole of the Southern
area, namely the region south of the Huai River. The latter city, Yangzhou, flourished as
a large economic and commercial center starting from the Tang era.",-
Iwata2010,"One internal factor that may have had a serious effect on lexical changes was the
development of word accent, namely stress, which was brought about by the increase of
polysyllabic words, in effect a compensation effect caused by the simplification of
phonological structure. Word stress thus produced the following patterns, and is
currently observed in the majority of Northern dialects, typically the dialect of Beijing.


 
 * Bi-syllabic structure: Strong-weak (trochee)
 * Tri-syllabic structure: Medium-weak-strong",-
Iwata2010,"Turning back to the topic of time words, we find that the tri-syllabic form thus
produced by the function of analogical attraction, namely jin ri ge, has completely
disappeared, with its phonetic variant jin er ge being retained in a small number of
localities in North China. This is because the accent rule for tri-syllabic structure, i.e.,
medium-weak-strong, has been applied to the time words, giving birth to a successive
change described as follows:
 
* jin ri ge > jin er ge > jinr ge > jin ge or ji ge
 
This is considered a weakening process of the head, ri, which ultimately changed
to the non-syllabic retroflex ending by fusing with the preceding syllable, namely jinr
ge, the form still existing in Beijing. In Jianghuai, the change has proceeded one step
further, leaving no trace of the original head in the form jin ge.","ordered character states"

minimizing the number of changes on the tree; it is an optimality approach

phylogeny in a way that minimizes evolutionary change in that trait.","parsimony, character mapping"

assumes that evolutionary transitions are equally probable on the longest
branch and the shortest branch on a phylogeny. It is also important to realize
that parsimony cannot always reconstruct a character state unambiguously.
In such cases, multiple equally parsimonious reconstructions can result, and
equivocal values are indicated with a node having multiple states.","character mapping, parsimony"
Nunn2011,"For example, traits can be ordered or unordered, and this affects how trait changes on the tree are converted into different numbers of
evolutionary steps. In an ordered series of more than two character states, it
is assumed that traits pass through intervening states to go from one end of
the trait spectrum to the other end.","ordered character states, parsimony"
Nunn2011,"For example, we might assume that traits are irreversible: once they are gained, they cannot be lost. Or we could assume that it is
easier to lose a trait than to gain it, in what is called Dollo parsimony. In this
case, only one gain is allowed, but multiple losses can occur. Another option
is to base the transformation on the ages of strata, or, stratigraphic parsimony,
which allows paleontologists to assess how well a phylogeny corresponds to

information on branch lengths; this is important, because a longer branch offers more opportunities for change to occur than a shorter branch. Another
important advantage of maximum likelihood is that it provides a way to assess statistical support for one reconstructed ancestral state over one or more
other reconstructed states.","maximum likelihood, character mapping"
Nunn2011,"In this application of Bayesian methods, the user estimates the probability that an ancestral node has a
particular character state based on data involving the character states in extant species and how they are related (a dated phylogeny), and also takes into
account mapping uncertainty by quantifying uncertainty in the transition rate
parameters that are used to reconstruct trait evolution (Ronquist 2004).","Bayesian approaches, character mapping"
Nunn2011,"Thus, rather than estimating the reconstruction based only on optimization of the transition rates,
they examined the distribution of reconstructed states given potential error
in estimating these rates. Importantly, one can also sample different phylogenies using MCMC, and this effectively deals with the problem that different
trees can produce different reconstructions of evolutionary history (Huelsenbeck and Bollback 2001; Lutzoni et  al. 2001; Pagel et  al. 2004).",-

event allows the testing of the algorithm on real biological data while having a
positive control. However, only the specific case of very recently introduced genes
can be simulated. Furthermore, real occurences of LGTs may already be present
in the dataset and their signals may conflict with the artificially introduced ones.","lateral gene transfer, evaluation, LGT detection"
Dessimoz2008,"This paper presents an algorithm to detect lateral gene transfer (LGT) on the basis of pairwise evolutionary distances. The prediction is made from a likelihood ratio derived from hypotheses of LGT versus no LGT, using multivariate normal theory. In contrast to approaches based on explicit phylogenetic LGT detection, it avoids the high computational cost and pitfalls associated with gene tree inference, while maintaining the high level of characterization obtainable from such methods (species involved in LGT, direction, distance to the LGT event in the past). We validate the algorithm empirically using both simulation and real data, and compare its predictions with standard methods and other studies.

Sagart2011,"Talk held on the Séminaire Sino-Tibétein du CRLAO. Proposes an innovation-based classification of the Chinese dialects. This classification is a family tree of the Chinese dialects in the true sense. Every split is established with help of specific innovations for the dialect groups identified by Sagart. Note, what is also important, that most innovations are lexical in their nature. Thus LS explicitly takes lexical innovations as the basis for dialect classification.",-
Sagart2011,"Li's theory was formed at a time when very few Chinese dialects had been analyzed for
corespondences with Middle Chinese. Those that had been were mostly the dialects of large cities.",-
Sagart2011,"Li did not give a tree. He seems to have assumed that first the different dialect groups that
compose Sinitic individualized, and that devoicing then happened separately in each dialect group,
before each group had time to differentiate into subdialects. So one feature (devoicing of voiced
stops) was enough in his view to classify Chinese dialects.","family tree, Chinese, Li Fang-Kuei, dialect classification, genetic classification, subgrouping, classification criteria"
Sagart2011,"There are two kinds of problems with Li's analysis. First, there are many more dialects analyzed
now than there were in 1938, and there are many, many exceptions to Li's generalizations. [...] The second problem relates to Wu. To say that the Wu dialects are a branch of Sinitic supposes
that they have a common ancestor which is more recent thant the common ancestor of all Chinese
dialects. To make that claim one needs to find a feature that they share exclusively; a feature that
is not found in other Chinese dialects and that the ancestor of all Chinese dialects did not share
either. We could then say that the change that brought this feature about took place in the ancestor
of Wu, and that is why all Wu dialects have it, and all non-wu dialects do not have it.","Wú, genetic classification, subgrouping, shared innovation, Li Fang-Kuei"
Sagart2011,"The principle we should remember is that one should classify languages on shared innovations
(=changes that occurred after the breakup of the most recent ancestral language of the group to
be classified). You cannot use shared retentions (=features that were already present in the
ancestor). You can use the change of b, d, g into p, t, k as a classification feature, but you cannot
use the absence of a change. This principle was first formulated by August Leskien in 1876.
Evolutionary biologists also use it. Classifying on shared retentions is a common fallacy.","shared innovation, genetic classification"
Sagart2011,"Norman defined three large groups of dialects: a northern group, corresponding to Mandarin,
defined by lexical innovations like having 他 for 3SG pronoun; 的 for attributive particle, 不 for
general negation, 站 'to stand', 走 'to walk', 儿子 'son', 房子 'house'. This is sound and the move
towards using lexical features is welcome. However his southern group (Min + Hakka +
Cantonese) is defined by the fact of NOT having these innovations. That is the same fallacy as in
Li's classification (`Norman <browse/Norman1988>`_ also has a central group: Wu+Gan+Xiang, which is transitional
between north and south).","genetic classification, Chinese, Southern Chinese hypothesis"
Sagart2011,"This is because sound changes spread easily (for instance palatalization of velars has spread across
Chinese dialects from Manchuria to south Jiangxi and SW Fujian in 300 years), while basic
vocabulary and morphology spread less. Sound changes will be used only as supporting material.","genetic classification, shared innovation, subgrouping"
Sagart2011,"Because of language contact, not all genuine innovations will stay in the language where they first
occurred. When that happens an innovation will give a false testimony. Not all the innovations one has assembled will be mutually compatible, in other words, compatible with the same genetic
tree. The approach followed here is to look for the largest possible set of innovations (in the basic
vocabulary/morphology) that is compatible with the same tree, and regard that tree as an
approximation of the true phylogeny. This is called a compatibility method (Meacham and
Estabrook 1985).","conflicting data, shared innovation, genetic classification, subgrouping"

the connotations are put forward for the first time by us , while some are supplementary to the old expressions of our ancestors. These
local dialects preserve some old accents. The preservation of “ Waxiang Dialect ” in the Youshui River basin of Southeast Chongqing is
especially precious for its stronger regional color. The causes of these phenomena are that Southeast Chonqing is bounded on the
northwest of Hunan , northeast of Guizhou and southwest of Hubei with mountains and rivers connected , water systems complicated
but interlinked , and people and culture often interacting. The Chinese and ethnic dialects in these areas are similar or almost the
same. These dialects have preserved many ancient accents and typical oral expressions which are similar to or the same as those of

Nunn2011,"More often, however, polytomies reflect uncertainty about the true branching order of a group of organisms. It could be that speciation events happened
so closely in time that the available morphological or molecular evidence can-
not discern the evolutionary relationships, or diff erent genes may have conflicting evolutionary histories (e.g., Maddison 1997), resulting in ambiguity at
a particular node. When a polytomy reflects uncertainty due to conflict in the

polytomy thus reflecting ignorance in our knowledge of the true evolutionary

the fewest evolutionary changes (i.e., most “parsimoniously”).","parsimony, phylogenetic reconstruction"
Nunn2011,"The *consistency index* (CI) and *retention index* (RI) are two statistics that
are commonly used in parsimony analyses to assess the degree of homoplasy
(see Maddison and Maddison 2000). These metrics have become important
in evolutionary anthropology, because they are used to study aspects of cultural evolution (Collard et al. 2006a; see also chapter 10). The CI provides a
measure of the amount of homoplasy in a tree and can be calculated for an
entire set of characters (the ensemble CI) or for a single character (Maddison
and Maddison 2000). For a single character, it is calculated as *CI = m / s*,
where *m* is the minimum number of possible evolutionary steps on a tree
and *s* is the actual number of reconstructed steps. A higher amount of homoplasy results in higher *s* and thus a lower CI, while a tree without homoplasy
has a CI of 1. Th e RI measures the degree to which potential synapomorphy
is exhibited on the tree. For a single character, it is calculated as *RI = (h − s) /
(h − m)*, where *h* is the maximum number of steps possible for a character and
the other variables correspond to those just given for the CI. An RI of 1 indicates that the character is completely consistent with phylogeny (i.e., it shows
no homoplasy), while an RI of 0 indicates the maximum amount of homoplasy that is possible.The CI increases as the number species in the analysis
increases and thus requires a correction term when comparing values among
data sets with different numbers of species (Sanderson and Donoghue 1989;
Hauser and Boyajian 1997). *Ensemble indices* are calculated in a similar way,
but for the whole set of characters in a data set rather than single characters
(Maddison and Maddison 2000).","parsimoy, consistency index, retention index, phylogenetic reconstruction, homoplasy"

trait data, a probability model of character evolution, and a hypothesis of phylogeny with branch lengths. From these, one can obtain the likelihood of the

process that, above all others, is fundamental to classification is comparison, which
leads to the establishment of rigorously attested correspondence sets. In ordinary
circumstances correspondence sets should be made up of words that are in some
sense basic to the language. This work can be done with a minimal set of highly
diagnostic forms, but far better results come with large corpora and extensive

tree-like patterns, possibly blurred by borrowing, but they can also develop in non-tree-like schemes.
For instance, diglossia, as in the case of Chinese, can counterbalance the hierarchical pattern expected
from differentiation by internal change associated with isolation by distance of speech communities. Using
two lexical datasets, either the basic lexicon supposedly more immune to borrowing or a representative
sample of the whole lexicon, we investigate the development pattern of Chinese dialects using a neighbour-net approach, which is an unprejudiced technique for representing object relationships. The resulting
graphs are consistent with a dialect continuum shaped by counterbalanced effects of homogenizing
diglossia and borrowing versus differentiating spread of speech communities. Historical events and
linguistic claims can be mapped on these graphs.","bilingualism, Chinese dialects, subgrouping, Neighbor-Net"

Norman1988,"We have already indicated in Chapter 1 that Chinese is monosyllabic from a morphemic point of view: almost every syllable corresponds to a morpheme. There is a sense in which Chinese is also phonologically monosyllabic. In almost all descriptions of Chinese, the syllable is taken as a kind of self-contained entity which forms the basis of phonological description. It may be that this approach is to some extent influenced by the writing system in which each unit represents a single syllable, but other factors enter in as well. It would seem, for example, in historical comparison that the syllable is the largest relevant unit; another important feature of Chinese dialects, (and perhaps of other monosyllabic languages as well) is that any one dialect contains a fixed number of possible syllables. Even when new terms are borrowed from foreign languages, they are interpreted in terms of the existing set of syllables [...]. A further consideration is that most phonological processes affect the syllable without reference to its lower level constituents.","Chinese, syllable structure, monosyllabicity"
Fox1995,"A further factor in establishing these correspondences is that of POSITION in the string of phonemes [...].

Fox1995,"We may note finally the question of the number of forms that are required to constitute a reliable correspondence set, and to allow us to say that the correspondence is a regular one. <a href=""Meillet1937"">Meillet (1937: 340)</a> proposes that, for the purposes of lexical comparison at least, a minimum of three `witnesses' is required (the `three witness' requirement). Elsewhere he writes: `An agreement of two languages, if it is not complete, risks being fortuitous. But if the agreement is extended to three, four or five very different languages, chance becomes less likely' (<a href=""Meillet1925"">1925</a>: 38; quoted from the English edition of 1967). <a href=""Hoenigswald1950"">Hoenigswald (1950)</a> comments, however, that: <br>

to guard agains the effects of secondary developments in daughter languages, we may refer to Meillet's rule that in reconstructing the vocabulary of a proto-language we need the testimony of three, rather than two, independent witnesses. For many other purposes, however, reconstruction from more than two witnesses may well be viewed as a mere extension of the fundamental operation involving only two.</span><br>
In practice, therefore, the reliability of the reconstruction may increase with the number of witnesses, but it is not really possible to stipulate how many witnesses are actually required to ensure that a correspondence is regular; the principles of reconstruction are the same, regardless of the number of languages compared.","comparative method, sample size, sound correspondences"
Snel2002,"In the course of evolution, genomes are shaped by processes like gene loss, gene duplication, horizontal gene
transfer, and gene genesis (the de novo origin of genes). Here we reconstruct the gene content of ancestral
Archaea and Proteobacteria and quantify the processes connecting them to their present day representatives
based on the distribution of genes in completely sequenced genomes. We estimate that the ancestor of the
Proteobacteria contained around 2500 genes, and the ancestor of the Archaea around 2050 genes. Although it
is necessary to invoke horizontal gene transfer to explain the content of present day genomes, gene loss, gene
genesis, and simple vertical inheritance are quantitatively the most dominant processes in shaping the genome.
Together they result in a turnover of gene content such that even the lineage leading from the ancestor of the
Proteobacteria to the relatively large genome of Escherichia coli has lost at least 950 genes. Gene loss, unlike the
other processes, correlates fairly well with time. This clock-like behavior suggests that gene loss is under negative
selection, while the processes that add genes are under positive selection.",-
Snel2002,"This article mentions in the end a technique to handle fused genes. This may be important and interesting, since fused genes are similar to cases of partial cognacy in historical linguistics.
The technique for inference is based on some kind of parsimony, but it is not entirely clear, which principles it is generally based upon: inclusion of LGT is modelled as separate events on the reference tree, which is standard. However, the penalties for LGT events are assumed to be always more than those for loss events. This seems to have some obvious reason in biology which I'm not aware of.

The CCM procedure yields reliable statistical inferences about historical
connections between languages: it classifies languages correctly for well-
known families (Indo-European and Semitic) and does not appear to yield
false positives. The quantitative patterns of similarity that we document for
languages within the Altaic family are similar to those in the non-

Comparison of the genomes of single-celled eukaryotes, multicellular plants and animals has also shown that the evolution of multicellularity was accompanied by the assembly of numerous novel extracellular matrix proteins and extracellular signalling proteins that are absolutely essential for multicellularity. There is now strong evidence that exon-shuffling played a general role in the assembly of the modular proteins involved in extracellular communications of metazoa. Although some of these proteins seem to be shared by all major groups of metazoa, others are restricted to certain evolutionary lineages.

either of the two traditional approaches of abstract generalization (Gesamtbedeu-

meaning activation and meaning determination which combine meaning potentials
with each other and with contextually given information rather than by some sim-

type meanings of one of the two traditional kinds. To establish this goal, I first
present the traditional notions and discuss some problems which arise when trying
to handle variation in meaning. I then specifically discuss the relation of
homonymy and polysemy to the traditional notions. In section 3, I introduce the
notion of “meaning potentials” as an alternative to the traditional notions and then
discuss in section 4 how this notion might be used to handle problems of meaning

Prokic2013,"In this paper we combine the geographic variation of closely related language variants (‘dialects’) with the distribution of sound correspondences through the lexicon. One of the central problems with sound correspondences at the dialect level is that they are not very regular, especially when they are investigated in sufficient detail. Sound changes spread both through a language (e.g., from one word to another) and through the population of speakers (in our case through a population of villages with different dialects). Both processes happen at the same time, and the challenge is to reconstruct what has happened from a snapshot of synchronic data. The method described in this paper allows us to track the geographic spread of sound changes and the underlying patterns of linguistic diversity simultaneously. By combining the two, it is possible to detect areas of intensive linguistic contact and gain better insight into the mechanisms of language change.","networks, sound correspondences, linguistic area"

domain viz. recognizing arbitrary multi-digit numbers from Street View imagery.
Traditional approaches to solve this problem typically separate out the localiza-

proach that integrates these three steps via the use of a deep convolutional neu-
ral network that operates directly on the image pixels. We employ the DistBe-

large, distributed neural networks on high quality images. We find that the per-
formance of this approach increases with the depth of the convolutional network,
with the best performance occurring in the deepest architecture we trained, with
eleven hidden layers. We evaluate this approach on the publicly available SVHN
dataset and achieve over 96% accuracy in recognizing complete street numbers.
We show that on a per-digit recognition task, we improve upon the state-of-the-
art, achieving 97.84% accuracy. We also evaluate this approach on an even more
challenging dataset generated from Street View imagery containing several tens of
millions of street number annotations and achieve over 90% accuracy. To further
explore the applicability of the proposed system to broader text recognition tasks,
we apply it to transcribing synthetic distorted text from a popular CAPTCHA ser-
vice, reCAPTCHA. reCAPTCHA is one of the most secure reverse turing tests
that uses distorted text as one of the cues to distinguish humans from bots. With
the proposed approach we report a 99.8% accuracy on transcribing the hardest cat-

specific families is a difficult but important problem in biological
research. One useful approach for tackling this problem involves
representing the sequence dataset as a protein similarity network,
and afterwards clustering the network using advanced graph
analysis techniques. Although a multitude of such network clustering
algorithms have been developed over the past few years, comparing
algorithms is often difficult because performance is affected
by the specifics of network construction. We investigate an
important aspect of network construction used in analyzing protein
superfamilies and present a heuristic approach for improving the
performance of several algorithms.

**Results:** We analyzed how the performance of network clustering
algorithms relates to thresholding the network prior to clustering. Our
results, over four different datasets, show how for each input dataset
there exists an optimal threshold range over which an algorithm
generates its most accurate clustering output. Our results further
show how the optimal threshold range correlates with the shape
of the edge weight distribution for the input similarity network. We
used this correlation to develop an automated threshold selection
heuristic in order to most optimally filter a similarity network prior to
clustering. This heuristic allows researchers to process their protein
datasets with runtime efficient network clustering algorithms without
sacrificing the clustering accuracy of the final results.

Thus, the child in such a speech community must learn for each new word not only a string of supraglottal gestures with various excitation sources (voicing, turbulence, *etc.*) but also distinctive states and movements of pitch. ","tone, tone language"
Abramson2004,"It is truly impressive that using the techniques of comparative linguistics, scholars began linking the rise of tones in Asian language families with certain presumed phonetic properties of initial and final consonants in the ancestral languages. Henri Maspero (1911, 1912) did so at a time when experimental phonetic data bearing on the topic were not yet available. In spite of André-G. Haudricouts's scientific background in botany, it apparently did not occur to him to look into the existing literature on the production and perception of speech. At the time of his paper (@<Haudricourt>1954) on the rise of tones in Vietnamese some research providing acoustic underpinnings to his arguments had been done (*e.g.*, House & Fairbanks, 1953), but, as far as I know, he never showed awareness of such research in his later writings.","tonogenesis, sound change"
Haudricourt1954,"This article describes the origin of tones in Vietnames and was one of the first articles that was published on #tonogenesis in South East Asian languages.","sound change, Vietnamese, tonogenesis"
Abramson2004,"The gist of his reasoning [i.e. the arguments of @Haudricourt1954, JML] is as follows. At the beginning of the Common Era Vietnamese was toneless. As show in Table 1, there were three syllable types that ultimately gave rise to tones;l all three had distinctive voicing in initial stop consonants: (1) open syllables, *i.e.*, those ending in a vowel or nasal, (2) syllables formerly checked with a final voiceless spirant that had become /h/, and (3) syllables formerly checked with some kind of stop, symbolized by /X/, that had become glottal stop.

[...]

The emergence of three tones in Vietnames by the end of the sixth century is apparent to Haudricourt. As shown in Table 2, characteristics of the syllable endings given in Table 1 created two contour tones as deviations from an uninflected level, the mid tone. Before disappearing, the final aspiration of the second column of Table 1 caused relaxation of the vocal folds (""le relâchement des cored vocales"") and a concomitant lowering of the pitch of the preceding voiced portion of the vowel.  On the other hand, before dropping out of the system, the final glottal closure [pb] of the third column of Table 1 led to an increase in tension of the vocal folds (""l'augmentation de tension des cordes vocales"") with a resulting rising pitch. With the loss of the old syllable-endings the remaining pitch features took over the role of phonological distinctiveness. For this stage of the language the voicing distinction in initial position is still in place.

Abramson2004," 

They had young adults, native speakers of American English at the University of Illinois, record many utterances of six English vowels with identical initial and final consonants, English /ptkfsbdgvzmn/. Thus the voicing, oral-nasal, stop-fricative, and palce-of-articulation contrasts were represented, with each syllable beginning and endign with the same consonant. The vocalic properties measured were duration, fundamental frequency (*F₀*), and relative power. Of concern to us here is their finding that vowels in a voiceless environment hat a higher *F₀* (109, Figure 2). [...] They point out (106) that a search of the available literature failed to show any effect of syllable-finals on *F₀*; however, in a recent study of Italian (Esposito, 2002) there was no evidence of an effect of syllable-final consonantal voicing on preceding vowels. Also in another paper (Lea, 1973), acoustic evidence of no effect on *F₀* of final segments is presented. 

","tonogenesis, speech acoustics, experimental phonetics "
Abramson2004,"The foregoing acoustic findings demonstrated a clear correlation between voicing states of initial consonants and the *F₀* heights of acompanying vowels. At least one piece of research lends credence to the posited effect of syllable-final elements. Fairly early in this program of research into tonogenesis, then, there seemed to be a substantive base for the logic of the historical linguists.","tonogenesis, speech acoustics"
Matisoff1973,"If the laryngeal mechanisms we have been considering are really universal, why haven't all human languages been tonal at some point in their history, like chinese, Burmese, or Jinghpaw? Some language families seem more hospitable to the development of tones than others, and the same goes for geographic areas of the world. It is as if the seeds of tone potential required a particularly fertile soil of a certain structural type in order to take root and flourish. In particular, it appears that to become truly tonal a langauge must have a basically **monosyllabic** structure (i.e. the morphemes must be only one syllable long). Polysyllabic languages like Japanese, Swedish, or Serbo-Croatian may develop ""pitch-accent"" systems, but these differ from true tone-systems in many important respects.","monosyllabicity, tonogenesis, sound change, language universals"

""In this [pb] revised version of tonogenesis, then, tones come about because of a cluster of losses combined with constraints that will not permit these losses to be compensated for on the segmental level. metaphorically, the langauge has 'nowhere to go' but to the suprasegmental level if it is to maintain the order of magnitude of distinctions it has had."" ","tonogenesis, monosyllabicity"
Thurgood2002,"Our most widely-used model of tonogenesis is Haudricourt’s @<Haudricourt>1954 classic analysis of Vietnamese tonogenesis. This paper examines Vietnamese evidence and this dominant model of tonogenesis, arguing that the Haudricourt analysis should be updated, replacing its segmentally-driven model by a laryngeally-based model, incorporating the effects of voice-quality distinctions.

This proposed model provides phonetically-plausible paths of change, not just for Vietnamese, but also for the widely- attested correlations between initial voicing and pitch height and between voice quality and vowel quality. At the same time, these same laryngeal considerations provide a phonetic motivation for the preference for the development of breathy voice from voiced stop onsets over sonorants and fricatives. Of equal importance, the model appears to provide significant insights into tonogenesis in Southeast Asia, East Asia, South Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas, that is, the applicability model is not restricted to any particular geographical area. ","tonogenesis, sound change"
Abramson2004,"@Thurgood<2002> develops a model based on properties of laryngeal control. One such crucial property is phonation type with voice quality as its principal auditory correlate. Two departures from model (clear or normal) voice of concern here are creaky voice and breathy voice. in some languages these phonation types are grouped with other phonetic properties to form phonologically distinctive register complexes. These complexes may be distinguished by differences in such features as voice quality, pitch, and vowel quality. In his broad overview of both the historical linguistic and the instrumental phonetic literature Thurgood concludes that not voiced sonorants or fricatives normally but voiced obstruents, since only they are likely to impart breath voice to vollowing vowels, bring about lowering of pitch. he beleives that his model is better able to handle tonogenesis not only in Southeast Asia but also elsewhere in the world.","tonogenesis, sound change, phonation type"
Abramson2004," @Haudricourt1954, final /h/ lowered the *F₀* of the preceding vowel  and final /?/ raised it. Supposedly this happened in other families too. Only one source that I can find (Homber, 1978, 92-95), a substantial one at that, lends direct support to the acoustic and perceptual plausibility of this reconstruction. ","tonogenesis, sound change, final consonants"
Abramson2004,"The phonetic evidence reviewed here lends credence to the broad lines of the historical linguistics arguments for tonogenesis. The seeds of change are small perturbations of fundamental frequency that are not under the control of the speaker. That is, in times of relative stability these minor pitch shifts are presumably not noticed as such. They are automatic int he context of certain syllable-final or syllable-initial consonantal properties. For example, they are neither produced nor heard as part of the stress pattern of a word or as part of an intonation pattern. [...] Thus, in the ""tone-prone"" langauge families of concern to us here, the weakening of the consonantal voicing contrast, probably with an intermediate stage of a phonation-type contrast, could well have facilitated the enhancement of previously redundant pitch to tonal status.","tonogenesis, experimental phonetics"
Abramson2004,"A way of understanding this process is through the concept of parsing (Fowler & Brown, 1997). [...] the listener parses out the *F₀* perturbations from the intonational, accentual, or tonal contour of the linguistic expression and uses them only for aid in identifying the voicing state of the consonant. Such a perturbation is ignored, it would seem, in responding to the overall pitch contour of the utterance. It, however, is ripe for advancement to a new phonological function if the language, for one reason or another, begins to lose the consonantal distinction with which the perturbation has been linked and the language is threatened with burdensome homophony.","tonogenesis, homonymy, homophony, monosyllabicity"

found throughout the period of observation. Approximately half of the innovations
(46.67%) were based on nouns, for example compounds consisting of two nouns as in
Automensch ‘carman’ or Murmeltreppe ‘marblestair.’ The other half of the innovations

Thirty mother–child dyads participated. Means of word formation and resulting word categories were analyzed in children’s spontaneous speech at ages 1;9, 1;11, 2;6, and 3;0. In contrast to the acquisition of English, the results show simultaneous development of compounds and derivations. German toddlers produce more verbal than nominal derivations and more compounds based on verbs than on nouns.

Mielke2008,"This book represents my attempt to Wnd out where distinctive features come from.
I should say that it started with a general uneasiness about the innateness of
features. Uneasiness by itself is not helpful, so my goal was to take the issues of
innateness and universality seriously, and to assemble data that would help to
answer some open questions and evaluate some assumptions. It has never been my
intention to discredit or disparage the work that has been done in the framework
of innate distinctive features, and most of the questions I have intended to address
could not even be formulated without it. Innate feature theory has provided a way
to talk about interesting generalizations about sound patterns, and I believe
emergent features mean reconsidering the speciWc mechanisms behind some of
these generalizations (history or physiology vs. Universal Grammar), but do not
undermine the generalizations themselves. In most cases, evaluating innate feature
proposals is not a matter of right vs. wrong but a matter of literal vs. metaphorical,
and Iunderstand that for a lot of researchers, it was metaphorical all along. I believe
that reinterpreting features as emergent allows feature theory to be better equipped
to deal with language, and in this book I have made an eVort to illustrate how the
insights of innate feature theory can be retained and how new insights are made
possible when features are treated as emergent.","distinctive features, sound classes"
Kemler2003,"Two studies investigated whether four-year-old children (12 in Exper-
iment 1 with a mean age of 4; 8 and 36 in Experiment 2 with a mean age
of 4; 7) invent names for new artifacts based on the objects’ functions as
opposed to their perceptual properties. Children informed about the
intended functions of novel objects provided more name innovations
that were clearly function-based than perception-based. This tendency
was observed when children were shown the objects’ functions, even
if they were also given verbal descriptions of the objects’ perceptual
properties and parts. Only when ignorant of the objects’ intended
functions did children tend to use perceptual features to create substan-
tial numbers of names. Accordingly, results from this name-innovation
methodology converge with findings from some recent studies of lexical
categorization suggesting that functional information is critical to how
preschoolers extend artifact names. Children appear to appreciate an
intimate relation between the functions of artifacts and how they are
named.","name inventions, denotation"
Sloman1996,"Distinctions have been proposed between systems of reasoning for centuries. This article distills properties shared by many of these distinctions and characterizes the resulting systems in light of recent findings and theoretical developments. One system is associative because its computations reflect similartiy structure and relations of temporal contiguity. The other is ""rule based"" because it operates on symbolic structures that have logical content and variables and because its computations have the properties that are normally assigned to rules. The systems serve complementary functions and can simultaneously generate different solutions to a reasoning problem. The rule-based system can suppress the associative system but not completely inhibit it. The article reviews evidence in favor of the distinction and its characterization.","modes of reasoning, categorization, cognition"
Tverksy1984,"Concepts may be organized into taxonomies varying in inclusiveness or abstraction, such as furniture, table, card table or animal, bird, robin. For taxonomies of common objects and organisms, the basic level, the level of table and bird, has been determined to be most informative (Rosch, Mervis, Gray, Johnson, & Boyes-Braem, 1976). Psychology, linguistics, and anthropology have produced a variety of measures of perception, behavior, and communication that converge on the basic level. Here, we present data showing that the basic level differs qualitatively from other levels in taxonomies of objects and of living things and present an explanation for why so many measures converge at that level. 
 
We have found that part terms proliferate in subjects' listings of attributes characterizing category members at the basic level, but are rarely listed at a general level. At a more specific level, fewer parts are listed, though more are judged to be true. Basic level objects are distinguished from one another by parts, but members of subordinate categories share parts and differ from one another on other attributes. Informants agree on the parts of objects, and also on relative ""goodness"" of the various parts. Perceptual salience and functional significance both appear to contribute to perceived part goodness. Names of parts frequently enjoy a duality not evident in names of other attributes; they refer at once to a particular appearance and to a particular function. 

We propose that part configuration underlies the various empirical operations of perception, behavior, and communication that converge at the basic level. Part configuration underlies the perceptual measures because it determines the shapes of objects to a large degree. Parts underlie the behavioral tasks because most of our behaviors is indirect toward parts of objects. Labeling appears to follow the natural breaks of perception and behavior; consequently, part configuration also underlies communication measures. Because elements of more abstract taxonomies, such as scenes and events, can also be decomposed into parts, this analysis provides a bridge to organization in other domains of knowledge. 
 
Knowledge organization by parts (partonomy) is contrasted to organization by kinds (taxonomy). Taxonomies serve to organize numerous classes of entities and to allow inference from larger sets to sets included in them. Partonomies serve to separate entities into their structural components and to organize knowledge of function by components of structure. The informativeness of the basic level may originate from the availability of inference from structure to function at that level.","taxonomy, partonomy, knowledge organization, cognition"
Tversky1986,"Geometric models impose an upper bound on the number of points that can share the same nearest neighbor. A much more restrictive bound is implied by the assumption that the data points represent a sample from some continuous distribution in a multidimensional Euclidean space. Analysis of 100 data sets showed that most perceptual data satisfy the geometric-statistical bound, whereas many conceptual data sets exceed it. The most striking discrepancies between the data and their multidimensional representations arise in semantic fields when the stimulus set includes a focal element (e.g., a superordinate category) that is the nearest neighbor of many of its instances. Theoretical and methodological implications of nearest neighbor analysis are discussed.","conceptualization, cognition, categorization"
Ungerer1994,"If we try to explain word meanings in terms of underlying mental concepts, we find that concepts like 'car', 'table' and 'dog' have a crucial function in identifying and classifying the objects and organismns of the world around us, and may therefore be said to represent ab asic level of categorization. Starting from this premise, the paper postulates that basic level concepts can also be assumed for actions, states, physical properties and locations, a view supported by previous research on colours, cshapes and prepositional concepts. Compared with 'car', 'table' and 'dog', superordinate concepts like 'vehicle', 'furniture' and 'animal' have a different structure, which highlights one or several salient attributes ('moving people around' int he case of 'vehicle'). Additional atttributes [sic!] are drawn from related basic level concepts ('car', 'bus', 'bicycle') if necessary, which measn that they are available via 'parasitic' categorization, and this has important implications for our understanding of lexical hierarchies. Emition concepts and concepts of other mental phenomena have yet another structure in which metonymies and mataphors lay an important part. It is claimed that these relationships can also be understood in terms of parasitic categorization, and that lexical concepts in general can be integrated into a centric or centripetal view of conceptual taxonomies.","cognition, conceptualization, categorization, semantic hierarchies"

- basc level concepts are commonly expressed by words which have a simple morphological form, which first come to mind  and which are first learned by children (such as *dog*);
- basic level concepts have a large number of attributes which are shared by category members (e.g. by various types of dog) and are at the same time distinct from attributes of other basic level concepts (e.g. 'elephant' and 'bird');
- basic level concept srefer to objects and organisms which stimulate typical actions or motor movements (charis are connected with the action of sitting down, etc.);
- members of basic level concepts (e.g. all kinds of dogs) have a characteristic overall shape that is readily identified as such; this seems to favour holistic (or gestalt) perception;
- last but not least: basic level concepts are the prime examples of the prototype-cum-periphery structure, i.e. they comprise good and bad examples, with the prototype functioning as model for the categorization of the otehr category members.

Even if in Rosch's experiments (Rosch/Mervis 1975L 579), informants rated peas as best examples of vegetables and cars as best examples of vehicles, the concept 'pea' could not serve as a model for all other kinds of vegetables, nor could the concept 'car' be used as a model for a bicycle. [...] In sum, in order to categorize the concept of vegetable or vehicle, we find all sorts of ways of reverting to basic level concepts, and this is what I propose to call 'parasitic categorization'. ","superordinate concepts, conceptualization"
Ungerer1994,"To summarize the discussion so far, it seems to have suggested two things: first, conceptual structure may indeed vary and deviate from the cognitive standard model of a rich category structure; second, since basic level concepts hold a central position in the categorization of the world, other concepts, whether logically superordinate or subordinate, depend on them for their conceptual structure; this is what I have called parasitic categorization.","categorization, basic level concepts, parasitic categorization"

Ungerer1994,"The text introduces some elaboration of the idea of ""basic level concepts"". What is interesting in this context is that these basic level concepts seem (on the first sight) to come quite close to basic vocabulary concepts. So when working in the context of basic vocabulary, it might be worthwile to read this text again and carry out some closer comparison of the actual concepts named by Ungerer.","basic level concepts, basic vocabulary, conceptualization, cognition, categorization"
Ungerer1994,"1. The centrality of basic level concepts applies not only to nominal, but to non-nominal concepts such as actions, physical properties, locations and evidential states as well. It is supported by the notion of parasitic categorization, by which various other types of concepts are related to basic level concepts. The result is a centric or even centripetal conceptual system, which can be regarded as an alternative to 'logical' taxonomies based on class inclusion.
2. Apart from the cognitive 'standard model' of category structure (prototype and periphery, a large number of attributes, gestalt perception), which applies to concrete basic level concepts, there seems to exist a number of other category structures, of which sali[pb]ient attribute concepts (the superordinates), 'undifferentieated gestalt' concepts (the subordinates), metaphorical concepts and abstract concepts have been provisionally identified.
3. Basic level concepts seem to be linked to major word classes, yet these distinctions are overridden on the other levels, especially the metaphorical and abstract levels. One of the reasons is that parasitic categorization cuts across word class distinctions which apply on the basic level.","basic level concepts, parasitic categorization"

King1967,"The idea that functional load offers a tool of potentially great explanatory power in diachronic linguistics is shared by a number of contemporary linguists, particularly those influenced at first or second hand by Prague. It is the purpose of the present paper to investigate the hypothesis that functional load plays a significant role in sound change. I will attempt to demonstrate that functional load, if it is a factor in sound change at all, is one of the least important of those we know anything about, and that it is best disregarded in discussions centering on the cause and direction of phonological change.","sound change, functional load, explanation of sound change"
King1967,"Author gives a summary on different notions on functional load in the literature and tests their suitability to account for actual cases of sound change by computing functional load from empirical data, using a specific formula for the quantification of #functional_load and comparing the actual functional load of merged elements in Germanic languages.","functional load, sound change, explanation of sound change"
King1967,"The term FUNCTIONAL LOAD is customarily
used in linguistics to describe the extent and degree of contrast between linguistic units,
usually phonemes. In its simplest expression, functional load is a measure of the
number of minimal pairs which can be found for a given opposition. More generally, in phonology, it is a measure of the work which two phonemes (or a distinctive feature) do in keeping utterances apart-in other words, a gauge of the
frequency with which two phonemes contrast in all possible environments.","functional load, sound change"
King1967,"One of the most important of these devices was the avoidance of
homonymy (Gillieron 1918:14). His concept was not, of course, the same thing
as functional load, but it was close. The crucial point is that sound change in
Gilli6ron's view was restrained (though to an unstated and indefinite degree) by
the communicative function of language.","homonymy, sound change, functional load"
King1967,"Credit is usually given
to the founder of the Prague Circle, Vil6m Mathesius, for being the first to publish on functional load (Vachek 1966:65). Actually, Mathesius did not use the
term in either of his two early articles concerned with the degree of utilization of
phonemic oppositions (1929, 1931), using instead circumlocutions such as
'valeur fonctionnelle', 'l'utilisation fonctionnelle', and 'Grad der Ausniitzung
von phonologischen Einheiten'. It is, however, clear that he was dealing with
the concept of functional load, even if he did not use the specific French or
German term. Aside from the minor question of what terms Mathesius did or
did not use, it is of more importance in the present paper to observe that he regarded functional load as a purely descriptive device-as one part of a complete
phonological description of a language along with the roster of phonemes,
phonemic variants, distinctive features, and the rest (Mathesius 1931:148).","functional load, sound change"
King1967,"Thus, although functional load is felt, by most linguists acquainted with the
term, to be characteristic of the Prague Circle approach to phonology, the truth
of the matter is that, in the task of shaping functional load into a viable tool of
either synchronic or diachronic phonology, Prague did not get much beyond
Gillieron's concept of the clash of homonyms. And, after all, one did not have to
be a member of the Prague Circle to suggest that Gillieron's ideas might be fruitfully incorporated into historical discussions based on the emerging concept of
the phoneme.","functional load, sound change"
King1967,"Given Martinet's initial hypothesis that sound changes do not operate independently of communicative needs, it is but a short step to his conjecture about
functional load: '... toutes choses égales d'ailleurs, une opposition phonologique
qui sert A maintenir distincts des centaines de mots parmi les plus frequents et
les plus utiles n'opposera-t-elle pas une résistance plus efficace a l'élimination
que celle qui ne rend de service que dans un tres petit nombre de cas?' (1955:54).
Thus, the requirement that communicative needs must be satisfied should help
prevent the merger of two phonemes whose opposition bears a high functional
load, while such a therapeutic factor need not assert itself to prevent the eradica-
tion of an opposition whose functional load is very small.","sound change, explanation of sound change, functional load"
King1967,"THE WEAK POINT HYPOTHESIS states that, if all else is equal, sound change is
more likely to start within oppositions bearing low functional loads than within [pb] oppositions bearing high functional loads; or, in the case of a single phoneme, a
phoneme of low frequency of occurrence is more likely to be affected by sound
change than is a high-frequency phoneme.
 
THE
LEAST RESISTANCE HYPOTHESIS states that, if all else is equal, and if (for
whatever reason) there is a tendency for a phoneme x to merge with either of the
two phonemes y or z, then that merger will occur for which the functional load
of the merged opposition is smaller
 
THE FREQUENCY HYPOTHESIS states that, if an opposition x :math:`\neq` y is destroyed
by merger, then that phoneme will disappear in the merger for which the relative

smaller than that of y, and y > x if the relative frequency of y is smaller than
that of x.","sound change, functional load"

into account syllable and word structure, or suprasegmentals. We shall say no
more about it.","functional load"
Surendran2006,"The definition was based on the information theoretic methods intro-

all possible utterances in the language. We can associate with a language/se-
quence L a positive real number H(L) representing how much information L
transmits.
Suppose x and y are phonemes in L. If they cannot be distinguished, then
each occurrence of x or y in L can be replaced by the occurrence of a new
(archi-)phoneme to get a new language L xy . Then the functional load of the x–y
opposition is as in (1):

:math:`FL(x,y) = \frac{H(L)-H(L_{xy})}{H(L)}`

BermudezOtero2007,"One of the basic challenges for diachronic phonology is the problem of
innovation: how does a phonological variant that has never existed previously in a speech community first come into being? Here, it is commonly
agreed that the potential for innovation leading to sound change arises
whenever speaker and listener fail to solve the coordination problem 2 posed
by speech: the speaker must produce a phonetic stimulus that enables the
listener to recover the intended phonological representation; the listener
must decide which properties of the incoming stimulus are intended by
the speaker as signal, and which properties are accidental noise; neither
participant can read the other’s mind. The innovation mechanisms proposed by @Ohala<1989>, *hypocorrection* and *hypercorrection*, both involve failures of
coordination: the listener does not parse the stimulus in the way that the
speaker intended (see e.g. Ohala 1989, Alderete & Frisch 16.3, Kingston
17.3.3).","sound change"
BermudezOtero2007,"In a pretheoretical sense, all phonological change is gradual: developments 
such as the raising of :sampa:`/A:/` to :sampa:`/O:/` in southern dialects of Middle English – 
and, a fortiori, large-scale upheavals like the Great Vowel Shift – do not take 
place overnight. However, this obvious fact does not imply that phonological change advances gradually in all dimensions.
 
One must first distinguish between graduality in implementation and
graduality in propagation.","sound change, sound change mechanisms"
BermudezOtero2007,"A change is said to be phonetically gradual – or gradient – if it involves a
continuous shift along one or more dimensions in phonetic space, such as
the frequency of the first formant of a vowel as measured in hertz. In
contrast, a change is phonetically abrupt – or categorical – if it involves
the substitution of one discrete phonological category for another: e.g.
replacing the feature [-high] with [+high] (see Harris 6.2.1). Deciding
whether the pattern created by a change is gradient or categorical often
requires careful instrumental analysis, as well as a global understanding of
the phonology–phonetics interface in the language in question (Myers
2000).","sound change, sound change mechanisms"
BermudezOtero2007,"Indeed, laboratory research has in recent times redressed the balance
between gradient and categorical rules in phonology (21.3.1). Languages
have been shown to vary with respect to the phonetic realization of phonological categories down to the finest detail: for example, contrary to the
assumptions of SPE (Chomsky & Halle 1968: 295), patterns of coarticulation
are not mechanical and universal, but cognitive and acquired (Keating
1988c:287–288; Pierrehumbert et al. 2000: 285–286). In addition, many
phenomena previously thought to be categorical have proved to be gradient (Myers 2000: 257).","sound change, sound change mechanisms"
BermudezOtero2007,"As a first approximation, lexically abrupt – or *regular* – implementation can be defined as follows: a change is regular if it applies at the
same time to all words that are identical with respect to the relevant
phonological, morphological, and syntactic conditions. In contrast, a
change is lexically gradual – or *diffusing* – if it affects certain words earlier
than others with an equivalent phonological and morphosyntactic
makeup, i.e. if lexical identity plays an irreducible rôle in controlling
the advance of the change. When applying this definition in practice,
one must take account of sociolinguistic variation: lexical diffusion can
manifest itself through a difference in the relative frequency with which
two words display the innovative variant, as long as this difference is
not determined by phonological, morphological, or syntactic conditions,
or by sociolinguistic factors (e.g. sex, age, social status, style, register,
etc.). Accordingly, establishing whether a particular change is regular or
diffusing often requires large data-sets and powerful statistical methods
(e.g. Labov 1994:Ch.16).","sound change, lexical diffusion, regular sound change, "
BermudezOtero2007,"When two initially homophonous words cease to be phonologically identical by undergoing different
processes of change, we have strong evidence for lexical diffusion (@Chen<1972>

Chen1972,"Students of historical linguistics have generally underestimated the diag
nostic significance of residual forms of sound changes which are, by and
large, regular. Linguists of the Neogrammarian persuasion understandably
tend to see only regular correspondences and overlook irregularities. Some
linguists show remarkable tolerance level to exceptions to sound laws either
because they cherish the glib optimism that somehow some day a rule will
be discovered to account for these exceptions, or because they can always
relegate these irregularities to marginal developments such as borrowing and
analogical leveling. On the other hand, for linguists who do not share the
Neogrammarian view, residues of regular sound changes simply do not pose
a problem. As a result, while irregularities are occasionally felt as annoying
necessary evil, they have never been given more than passing attention.
Without subscribing to the theoretical and empirical arguments underlying
the Neogrammarian doctrine, we can adopt the regularity hypothesis as a
working assumption. On this premise, a high tolerance level to irregularities
is incompatible with the accountability principle which has characterized the
methodology and style of modern linguistics. We want to seek an explanation
for irregular changes not only because exceptions are embarrassingly nu
merous and because the Neogrammarian optimism is unfounded but,
more importantly, because the inability to account for residual forms is diag
nostic of a fundamental inadequacy in a model of historical phonology in
which the time dimension of sound change is totally absent.","sound change, irregularity of sound change, regular sound change, lexical diffusion"
Chen1972,"When a phonological innovation enters a language it begins as a minor rule, affecting a small
number of words [...]. As the phonological innovation gradually spreads across the lexicon,
however, there comes a point when the minor rule gathers momentum and begins to serve as a basis
for extrapolation.  At this critical cross-over point, the minor rule becomes a major rule, and
we would expect diffusion to be much more rapid. The change may, however, reach a second point
of inflection and eventually taper off before it completes its course, leaving behind a handful
of words unaltered.","sound change, lexical diffusion, sound change mechanisms"

be resolved by distinguishing abstract phonological change from change in low-level
output rules. Both types of rules can be observed in recent studies of sound change in
progress in Philadelphia: the lexical split of short a shows lexical diffusion in progress,

Bybee2002,"The literature on frequency effects in lexical diffusion shows that even phonetically
gradual changes that in some cases are destined to be lexically regular show lexical
diffusion while they are in progress. Change that is both phonetically and lexically
gradual presents a serious challenge to theories with phonemic underlying forms.
An alternate exemplar model that can account for lexical variation in phonetic detail
is outlined here. This model predicts that the frequency with which words are used
in the contexts for change will affect how readily the word undergoes a change in
progress. This prediction is tested on data from 0t, d0 deletion in American English.
Finally, the effect of bound morphemes on the diffusion of a sound change is examined. The data suggest that instances of a bound morpheme can affect the rate of
change for that morpheme overall.","lexical diffusion, sound change, regular sound change, Neogrammarian sound change"
Bybee2002,"The hypothesis that sound change is lexically regular seems well supported by
the facts of change. When we observe that two languages or dialects exhibit a
phonological difference, it is very likely that this difference is regular across all
the words that have the appropriate phonetic environment. This observation is
fundamental to the comparative method; the establishment of genetic relations
and the reconstruction of protolanguages are based on the premise that sound
change affects all words equally. Schuchardt (1885) was one of the detractors
from this position. When he observed sound change in progress, he noted that all
words did not change at the same rate, and that the differences were not due to
“dialect mixture,” as was often claimed by the Neogrammarians, who supported
the regularity position.","sound change, linguistic reconstruction, Neogrammarian sound change, regular sound change, genetic classification"
Bybee2002,"A major challenge to the regularity position in the 20th century is expressed in
the work of Wang and his colleagues (Wang, 1969, 1977; Wang & Cheng, 1977),
which documented changes that seem to occur word by word over a long period
of time. While some of these changes result in lexical regularity, Wang and his
colleagues also identified changes that appear to be arrested after affecting only
part of the lexicon.","sound change, regular sound change, lexical diffusion"
Bybee2002,"Labov (@<Labov>1981, @<Labov>1994) also dealt with the issue, availing himself of the data from
his numerous studies of sound change in progress. He proposed two types of
sound change: “regular sound change” is gradual, phonetically motivated, without lexical or grammatical conditioning, and not influenced by social awareness,
whereas “lexical diffusion” change, such as the phenomena studied by Wang, is
“the result of the abrupt substitution of one phoneme for another in words that
contain that phoneme” (@Labov<1994>, 1994:542).","sound change, Neogrammarian sound change, lexical diffusion, sound change mechanisms"
Bybee2002,"Hooper (1976) identified a lexical diffusion paradox. Reductive sound change
tends to affect high frequency words before low-frequency words, but analogical

frequency words.","lexical diffusion"
Bybee2002,"Sound changes that are complete can be identified as regular or not, depending
upon whether they affected all lexical items existing at the time of the change.
Ongoing changes cannot be designated as regular or not, since they are not
complete. However, one can reference the typical characteristics of a change to
project whether it will be regular or not. That is, a phonetically gradual change
with clear phonetic conditioning falls into Labov’s first type, and thus we can
project its regularity. Here I document lexical diffusion from high-frequency to
low-frequency words in ongoing changes that can be expected to be regular, as
well as in certain reductive changes that may never be complete because of the
nature of the lexicon.","lexical diffusion, Neogrammarian sound change, regular sound change"

The data on this obstruent deletion process, then, suggests both lexical and
phonetic gradualness. It thus cannot be said that obstruent deletion is the abrupt
deletion of a phoneme. In fact, these data are problematic for any version of
phonemic theory. A model that can accommodate these data is presented later in
the article.","sound change, regular sound change, lexical diffusion"

**The regularity hypothesis.** The second breakthrough was achieved in the
1870's, in the emergence of what I shall call the REGULARITY hypothesis.","regularity hypothesis, sound change"
Hockett1965," Brugmann and Osthoff founded a
journal, Morphologische Untersuchungen, as an outlet for their own papers; the
first issue appeared in 1878 and included an introduction signed by both but
written by Brugmatm. In this, he accepted the originally humorous epithet
Junggrammatiker and used it as a rallying cry 'summoning students of compara-
tive linguistics ""forth from the hypothesis-laden atmosphere where Indo-Euro-
pean prototypes are fabricated ... into the clear air of tangible actuality of the
present"" ', and odiously naming himself and a few of his closest colleagues as the
sole possessors of The Truth.","Neogrammarian Manifesto"
Hockett1965,"I regard the regularity hypothesis as the second great breakthrough of our
science, and I think of it as an achievement largely of the 1870's; but I do not

Verner's almost plaintive remark already quoted, 'there must be a rule for ir-
regularity; the problem is to find it', comes closest-if we may be allowed to in-
terpret as plaintive an expression that Verner may not have intended so. More
important is the sequence of remarkable discoveries in Indo-European, made
during the decade or so in question in part by the Junggrammatiker and in part
by their opponents; the working assumptions ACTUALLY USED as these discoveries
were made, rather than any contemporary expression of them, are the true break-

open by the genetic hypothesis, which, you will recall, acknowledged the fact of
linguistic change but had nothing much to say about either how or why language
changes. The threefold classification was to some extent an answer to the how.

would be no discernible underlying regularity in linguistic change and the com-

Jespersen1922,"**Gradual Shiftings**

We
shall do well to put aside such artificial theories and look
soberly at the facts. When some sounds in one century go one
way, and in another, another, while at times they remain long
unchanged, it all rests on this, that for human habits of this sort
there is no standard measure. Set a man to saw a hundred logs,
measuring No. 2 by No. 1, No. 3 by No. 2, and so on, and you will
see considerable deviations from the original measure perhaps
all going in the same direction, so that No. 100 is very much
longer than No. 1 as the result of the sum of a great many small
deviations perhaps all going in the opposite direction
but it
is also possible that in a certain series he was inclined te make
the logs too long, and in the next series too short, the two sets
of deviations about balancing one another.

It is much the same with the formation of speech sounds
at one moment, for some reason or other, in a particular mood,
in order to lend authority or distinction to our words,
we may
happen to lower the jaw a little more, or to thrust the tongue a
little more forward than usual, or inversely, under the influence
of fatigue or laziness, or to sneer at someone else, or because we
have a cigar or potato in our mouth, the movements of the jaw
or of the tongue may fall short of what they usually are. We
have all the while a sort of conception of an average pronunciation,
of a normal degree of opening or of protrusion, which we aim
at, but it is nothing very fixed, and the only measure at our disposal
is that
we are or are not understood. What is understood
what does not meet this requirement must be repeated
with greater correctness as an answer to 'I beg your pardon?'

Everyone thinks that he talks to-day just as he did yesterday,
and, of course, he does so in nearly every point. But no one knows
if he pronounces his mother-tongue in every respect in the same
manner as he did twenty years ago. May we not suppose that what
happens with faces happens here also? One lives with a friend day
in and day out, and he appears to be just what he was years ago, but
someone who returns home after a long absence is at once struck
by the changes which have gradually accumulated in the interval.
 
Changes in the sounds of a language are not, indeed, so rapid
as those in the appearance of an individual, for the simple reason
that it is not enough for one man to alter his pronunciation, [pb]
many must co-operate:
the social nature and social aim of language has the natural consequence that all must combine in the
same movement, or else one neutralizes the changes introduced
each individual also is continually under the influence of his fellows, and involuntarily fashions his pronunciation
according to the impression he is constantly receiving of other people's sounds.
But as regards those little gradual shiftings of
sounds which take place in spite of all this control and its con-
servative influence, changes in which the sound and the articulation
alter simultaneously, I cannot see that the transmission of the
language to a new generation need exert any essential influence:
we may imagine them being brought about equally well in a society
which for hundreds of years consisted of the same adults who
never died and had no issue.

","sound change"
Hockett1965,"The quintessence of the quantization hypothesis can be stated as follows. In
any speech community, only certain DIFFERENCES of speech sound are functional.
This breaks the continuous multidimensional space of all possible speech sound
into a finite number of regions; in at least some environments it matters, to hearer
and thus to speaker, whether a given sound falls into one region or the next, but
does not matter where it falls within a single region.21 Successive articulations
aimed into the same region show a scatter, clustered around a LOCAL FREQUENCY
MAXIMUM. The local frequency maxima are, or create, the 'sort of conception of
an average pronunciation' of which Jespersen spoke. The frequency maxima,
[pb] 
then, are the neat discrete functioning units of the phonological system of the
language.","phonological principle"
Hockett1965,"
 
Sound change is not reducible to analogy: the latter leads only to the replacement of one array of distinctive features by another as the 'realization' of some
lexical or grammatical form. Sound change is affected by certain kinds of borrowing, in that so-called 'fashions of pronunciation', as in imitation of a prestigious
model, can alter the density distribution; but it is not REDUCIBLE to borrowing
because the density distribution is largely altered by innumerable tiny imprecisions of pronunciation and by constant channel noise-the kind of thing Jespersen
was talking about, but mostly on a much finer-grained scale-that take place
totally out of awareness.","sound change, explanation of sound change"
Hockett1965,"There remains to ask WHY sound change should go on. We must be careful
that our answer is not more complicated and obscure than the question. I shall
argue in general biological and physical terms, not from human psychology; indeed, what I am about to say has really already been said in the preceding discussion. I shall argue, first, that there is nothing in the design or use of language
to
PREVENT
sound change or, within wide limits, its structural consequences, and
second, that there is a factor in the universe to cause it. Sound change CAN go on
because language is redundant: most of the time, a hearer need register only a
suitably scattered small fraction of the stigmata of the speech signal in order to
know what has been said. Language, in turn, is redundant because otherwise
[pb]
it would have had no survival value for our species. Sound change DOES go on
because of NOISE. Only in a permanently noiseless universe would sound change
cease; but I think I could show on elementary physical principles that in a
permanently noiseless universe there would be no events, hence no information,
hence nothing to talk about and no language to talk with.","reasons for sound change, sound change"
Bybee2000,"In many areas of linguistics, examining the nature of diachronic changes
leads to a more accurate modeling of synchronic systems. Lexical diffusion - the way a sound change spreads through the lexicon - has, as yet, not
been exploited as a potential source of evidence about the phonological
shape of lexical representations. The present study contains evidence that
sound change is both phonetically gradual and lexically gradual, and that the
rate at which words undergo sound change is positively correlated with their
text frequency. This correlation is found in monomorphemic words, regu-
larly inflected words and irregularly inflected words. I argue that frequency
effects in sound change may be explained by assuming that cognitive repre-
sentations are impacted by every token of use.","sound change, explanation of sound change, lexical diffusion, regular sound change, sound change mechanisms"
Bybee2002," !exemplar_theory 

The model that can handle the facts just described must allow for gradual changes
in the phonetic representations of words, and it must also allow for the expression
of certain relations within and among exemplar clusters. As already demonstrated, reductive change occurs in production as already automated sequences of
linguistic elements are further reduced. These online reductions feed back into
memory representations, since the language user’s accumulated experience is [pb]
represented in memory. Words are represented as clusters of exemplars, and the
relative weight of exemplars with different patterns may change over time as
reduction proceeds. If the distribution of words in actual discourse contexts differs, the rate at which their exemplar clusters change, and thus the rate at which
they undergo a change, may differ.","sound change, exemplar theory"
Bybee2002,"Effects of frequency and context demonstrate that language use has an effect
on mental representations. In this view, representations and the grammatical structure that emerges from them are based on experience with language. New linguistic experiences are categorized in terms of already stored representations,
adding to the exemplar clusters already present and, at times, changing them
gradually. Various levels of abstraction emerge as exemplars are categorized by
phonological and semantic similarity—morphemes, words, phrases, and constructions can all be seen as the result of the categorization of linguistic experiences.","sound change, exemplar theory"
Martinet1984,"The difference between language in general and individual languages should always be kept in mind. The Saussurean dichotomy of langue vs. parole should yield before linguistically relevant vs. linguistically irrelevant. Languages should not be identified with codes. Proceeding inductively when trying to define the object of our science has proved impracticable. We should rather stipulate what we want to call a language. From a language we expect that it be actually used for communicating experience by means of a succession of vocal products analyzable into segments equated with some features of the total experience; each of those segments being analyzable into a succession of well-defined vocal units. Speaking here of dual patterning would obscure the fundamental hierarchy of the double articulation of language. The economical nature of double articulation is obvious: the vocal auditory nature of language, determining the linearity of speech, will automatically lead to it. But there is more to it than sheer economy: the analysis of experience into features corresponding to the significant units of a language makes it possible to communicate new experience by means of unexpected combinations of these units. The second articulation into phonemes is instrumental in stabilizing the perceptible forms by making them independant of the correspponding meanings.","double articulation, language model"

To my knowledge, the prediction that regular categorical change exists has
rarely, if ever, been explicitly discussed in the literature. As we shall see in
Section 21.3.2, however, there are powerful arguments in its favour.","sound change, sound change mechanisms"
BermudezOtero2007,"* Phase I
   - The life cycle starts with phonologization (Hyman 1976), which occurs when some physical or physiological phenomenon gives rise to a new cognitively controlled pattern of phonetic implementation through a coordination failure.
* Phase II
   - Subsequently, the new gradient sound pattern may become categorical. In
      the modular feedforward architecture in (2), such a change would involve
      the restructuring of the phonological representations that provide the
      input to phonetic implementation, with the concomitant development
      of a new phonological counterpart for the original phonetic rule.
* Phase III
   - Reanalysis can also cause categorical patterns to change. Over time, phonological rules typically become sensitive to morphosyntactic structure, often
     with a reduction in their domain of application 
* Phase IV
   - At the end of their life cycle, sound patterns may cease to be phonologically
     controlled. Thus, a phonological rule may be replaced by a morphological
     operation (morphologization), or may disappear altogether, leaving an idiosyncratic residue in lexical representations (lexicalization).","sound change, sound change patterns"
BermudezOtero2007,"

In nonmodular theories of the phonology–phonetics interface, in contrast,
a predictable allophone can remain after the loss of its conditioning environment only if it is already present in lexical representation (@Bybee<2001> 2001: Sec.3.6). 
However, this approach misses the crucial rôle of opacity in triggering lexical restructuring: see (7). Modular feedforward models capture
the right sequence of cause and effect: in the Sanskrit case [], the stabilization
of palatalization enabled it to interact opaquely with lowering; this opacity,
in turn, prompted lexical restructuring, with the attendant phonemic split.
","exemplar theory, modularity, language model"
BermudezOtero2007,"Essential to current functionalist thinking is the idea that the lexicon
consists of a vast repository of highly-detailed memory traces of phonetic
episodes experienced by the speaker: so-called ‘exemplars’ (Johnson 1997).
Exemplars are linked to one another by a network of connections based on
similarity in a high-dimensional phonetic space. Crucially, phonological
categories do not exist independently of the exemplars. This idea comes in
several versions.","exemplar theory"
BermudezOtero2007,"Moreover, gradient diffusion predicts that, over time, the lexicon will
preserve remnants of old phonemes and exceptions to new allophonic
patterns, all left behind by arrested changes. Indeed, if holistic phonetic
targets were kept in long-term memory in quite the same way as lexicalized [pb]
morphological constructs, then phonetic relics should be as unremarkable
as stored morphological irregularities like children, oxen, feet, or wolves.","exemplar theory, irregularity"

By this I do not mean that I intend to tyr to prevent sound change -- indeed, I do not think it is harmful at all and, in any case, there is little we could do to control it -- but rather that I will try to identify those causes which are the preconditions for sound change. As for the immediate triggers of sound change in a particular language at a particular time, I will have little to say about them except to suggest that these things are bound to happen and that it is not so interesting to try to identify them.

Ohala1989,"There exists in any speech community at any point in time a great deal of hidden variation in the pronunciation of words. [] By ""hidden"" I mean rather that speakers exhibit variations in their pronunciation which they and listeners usually do not recognize as variation. When pronunciation is transmitted, however, the existence of this variation can create ambiguity and lead to the listener's misapprehension of the intended pronunciation norm. A misapprehended pro[pb]nunciation is a changed pronunciation, i.e., sound change. Analogues of the mechanism I have in mind may be found in scribal errors made by mediaval manuscript copyists, in transcription errors between DNA and RNA, in the transmission errors of signals over telephone lines. In all of these cases as well as in normal spech transmission there is sufficient redundancy in the message to allow most such errors to be corrected, but the error correction is not perfect and so occasionally the signal is changed between the source and the destination.","sound change, synchronic variation, production"
Ohala1989,"One of the most important discoveries of modern instrumental phonetics is the incredible amount of variation that exists in pronunciation, not only between speakers but also in the speech of a single speaker.

","sound change, robustness, biological parallels"
Kitano2007,"Robustness is one of the fundamental characteristics of biological systems. Numerous reports have been published on how robustness is involved in various biological processes and on mechanisms that give rise to robustness in living systems (Savageau, 1985a, 1985b, 1998; Barkai and Leibler, 1997; Alon et al, 1999; von Dassow et al, 2000; Bhalla and Iyengar, 2001; Csete and Doyle, 2002, 2004; Kitano et al, 2004, 2004a, 2004b; Stelling et al, 2004; Kitano and Oda, 2006; Kitano, 2007a). With increasing interest in systems biology, properties at the system level such as robustness have attracted serious scientific research. Nevertheless, a mathematical foundation that provides a unified perspective on robustness is yet to be established. For systems biology to mature into a solid scientific discipline, there must be a solid theoretical and methodological foundation. Often, systems biology is equated with computer simulation of cells and organs. Although computer simulation is a powerful technique for clarifying the complex dynamics of biological systems, it is also a useful tool for exploring the foundation of biological systems. While investigation on the dynamic properties of specific aspects of organisms is scientifically significant and can be widely applied, it is a study on specific instances of design within a design space that is shaped by fundamental principles, structural, environmental, and evolutionary constraints. The scientific goal of systems biology is not merely to create precision models of cells and organs, but also to discover fundamental and structural principles behind biological systems that define the possible design space of life (Figure 1). The value of understanding fundamental and structural theories is that they provide deeper insights into the governing principles that complex evolvable systems including biological systems follow. Building a solid theoretical foundation of biological robustness, and in particular defining a mathematical formulation of robustness, represents a key challenge in Systems Biology. Such a framework would be enormously useful, as it would provide general constraints on possible architectural features of living organisms.","robustness, biology, biological parallels"
Ohala1989,"The mapping between vocal tract shape and the output sound is a many-to-one mapping, i.e. the same or similar sound may result from tow or more different vocal-tract configurations. When listeners repeat what they have heard they may use an articulation different from the original. 
Henry Sweet (1874: 15-16, 1900: 21-22) was among those who recognized thsi mechanism for sound change, exemplifying it with the variant forms of English 'through' as :sampa:`[TRu]` and :sampa:`[fRu]`.

A neogrammarian historical phonology accordingly consists of a list of sound changes together with an account of the apparent exceptions to each by means of these three factors.

Kiparsky1988,"First, @Bloomfield<1933> was able to add a simple and powerful argument in support of the EH: if sound changes were lexically idiosyncratic, then langauges would have assorted \`stray sounds' left over from the previous stages of their history.

Bloomfield1933,"Theoretically, we can understand the regular change of phonemes, if we suppose that langauge consists of two layers of habit. One layer is phonemic: the speakers have certain habits of voic[pb]ing, tongue movement, and so on. These habits make up the phonetic system of teh language. The other layer consists of formal-semantic habits: the speakers habitually utter certain combinations of phonemes in response to certain types of stimuli, and respond appropriately when they hear these same combinations. These habits make up the grammar and lexicon of the language.","sound change, language model, regularity hypothesis, regular sound change"
Kiparsky1988," @Bloomfield<1933> (364f) 
not only will tthere have to be two 'layers of habit' (levels of representation), but they must be mutually independent. Only if the 'phonetic system' is independent of the grammar and lexicon will it follow that the phonological structure of uttereances cannot be determined by their grammatical-lexical structure.`","sound change, phonological theory, levels of representation"
Kiparsky1988,"However, the prevalence of langauge contact and diversity in no way disconfirms the EH, specifically not the *causal* claim which lies at the heart of it, namely that exceptions do not develop internally to a system but only through the interference between systems. On the contrary, it makes that hypothesis more devensible by justifying the very assumptions of heterogeneity which must be invoked to explain away contrary evidence. But by the same token it substantially insulates the EH from the actual data of change, and so makes it harder to put an empirical test.","exceptionlessness hypothesis, irregularity of sound change"
Hoenigswald1978," There was a similarly awkward counter-plea to the effect that we cannot afford to allow exceptions because that would be the end of our efforts and put us, as it were, out of business -- as though a false principle was better than none at all.

Advocates of sporadic sound-change have occasionally asserted taht the question of sporadicity arises typically where particular phonetic properties and processes are involved; dissimilartions and haplologies are among the most familiar examples.  []  It wouild have been best to agree, without for a moment deviating from the working rules which Leskien and his colleagues consistenlty observed, not that all sound changes are discovered to be regular, but rather that regular changes are also called sound-changes, regularity being essentially a term for phonological statability.

Hoenigswald1978,"It is a customary piece of orthodoxy to reject the notion of langauge 'mixture' on the ground of some kind of principle and to assert, for instance, that English may be identified in some safe, immediate, and *a priori* fashion as a Germanic langauge with French borrowings, rather than as a Romance langauge with Germanic borrowings. Perhaps this can be done, but let us ntoe that teh criteria are not altogether general ones. Crude numbers are no use since, in an even case, we reserve the freedom to decide that 'a langauge', even though swamped by loandwords, ahs remained its own self. Grammatical traits, so highly prized ever since Ludolf and Gyarmathi (if not before), can be borrowed quite massively, as students of calques and of typological isoglosses have come to know. Perhapts it is possible to fall back on the concept of the base vocabulary as a guide to the true strain; but there are difficulties here as well, especially when the differences between the forms of speech are only on the dialectal scale.

Here Wang seems to overstate the case for phonetic abruptness. As we will see later on, for some changes of place of articulation for which no physiological continuum is apparent, articulatory pathways in fact exist. Others are known to be the result of language contact, and as such cannot be construed as evidence for abruptness in internal change. [...] In regular metathesis, it is not unusual to find that one of the segments involved in the apparent transposition is articulatorily minimal [...]. What appears to be an interchange of two entire segments may then be the result of a change in the timing of a very small number of muscular events -- similar to the phenomena which, we argue below, underlie assimilatory processes.

","gradient sound change, epenthesis"
Mowrey1995,"The general difficulty here is that the case for abruptness cannot be judged on the witness of orthography and broad transcription, since alphabetic units by their nature wil always testify that change is abrupt. For relevant testimony we must turn to phonetic accounts, whether based on the informal obervations of a Boas or Menéndez Pidal or on instrumental data. Although we expect abrupt substitution of one sound for another in cases of language contact, such finer-grained ata as we possess point to the phonetic gradualness of internal changes.","sound change, gradual sound change, contact-induced sound change"

First, the aetiological differences between sound change proper and other phenomena effecting the change of form over time are so obvious that the de facto abandonment of the distinction by generativists may be viewed as an aberration. [...] Secondly, that sound chagnes proceed in a lexically gradual rather than abrupt fashion has been more than amply demonstrated by Wang and others; the role of relative frequency in diffusion also appears to have been adequately documented. Third, evidence for the phonetic gradualness of at leas some processes assumed to be necessarily abrupt, though for obvious reasons more difficult to obtain and therefore less abundanant, si sufficient to suggest that the case for it has much more merit than Wang assumed. Fourth [...] variation is not only systematic but often reflects the action of changes in progress, and is [pb] thus necessarily within the domain of phenomena which a theory of sound change must address.","sound change mechanisms, phonetic gradualness"

","perception, production, sound change"
Mowrey1995,"We suggest that though auditory perception is implicated in changes arising in language contact, in which the differently-tuned speech perception systems of the speakers of an adopting language come into play, misperception does not provide a plausible explanatory basis for internal change, since the analyses depend on attributing to the speech perception system a tendency toward confusion and approximation which it does not appear to exhibit. Articulatory processes by which production patterns gradually change over time [...] thus appear to provide a better account of internal change. The nature of variation along the formal-to-casual speech continuum corroborates this conclusion. Not only does the relation between more formal and more casual speech modes seem to be most naturally characterizable as the product of unidirectionally reductive changes, but speakers effortlessly control the entire range of production along the continuum. This suggests that the reductive changes arise from on-line articulatory phenomena whose effects are incremental and continuous rather than from a series of events with a basis in misperception or reassignment.","perception, production, sound change, explanation of sound change"
Mowrey1995,"
We believe that it does no, and that the level of phonetic detail in the core lexical material of any given dialect in itself suggests taht such assumptions cannot be correct. In fact, given that speakers must acquire and store detail anyway, the linking of phonetic and semantic form -- the pairing of sound and meaning that linguists regard as their responsibility to explicate -- might be effected in a smoother way in a holistic model. 
[...]
We have argued that it is articulation directly -- rather than articulation mediated by perception, or psychological units of the nature of phonemes -- that changes in internal sound change, and that the locus of change is specific meaningful expressions, and not, or at least not in any primary sense, sounds or sound patterns independent of expressions.

Internal or evolutionary change (sound change) consists of just two types of changes in muscular activity patterns: temporal reduction, by which bursts of muscular activity become temporally more contiguous, and substantive reduction, by which burts of muscular activity diminish in amplitude. These two event types appear to provide straightforward accounts of most of the major types of phonological processes. [...] Evaluating the case for evolutionary epenthesis, we have concluded that it is weak. [] [pb] We do not expect that all cases of internal epenthesis will be explicable, nor do we intend to explain them all away. But even if every case were valid, epenthesis would still be statistically insignificant relative to reduction, and does not seem, to be observed in contemporary internal changes-in-progress.

The reduction of redundancy in signals or messages, especially those repeated often and therefore in part predictable, is automatic and advantageous.

Schouwstra2014,"Where do the different sentence orders in the languages of the world come from? Recently, it has been suggested that there is a basic sentence order, SOV (Subject–Object–Verb), which was the starting point for other sentence orders. Backup for this claim was found in newly emerging languages, as well as in experiments where people are asked to convey simple meanings in improvised gesture production. In both cases, researchers found that the predominant word order is SOV. Recent literature has shown that the pragmatic rule ‘Agent first’ drives the preference for S initial word order, but this rule does not decide between SOV and SVO. This paper presents experimental evidence for grounding the word order that emerges in gesture production in semantic properties of the message to be conveyed. We focus on the role of the verb, and argue that the preference for SOV word order reported in earlier experiments is due to the use of extensional verbs (e.g. throw). With intensional verbs like think, the object is dependent on the agent’s thought, and our experiment confirms that such verbs lead to a preference for SVO instead. We conclude that the meaning of the verb plays a crucial role in the sequencing of utterances in emerging language systems. This finding is relevant for the debate on language evolution, because it suggests that semantics underlies the early formation of syntactic rules.","word order, syntax, language evolution"
Li2013,"Identification of communities in complex networks is an important topic and issue in many fields such as sociology, biology, and computer science. Communities are often defined as groups of related nodes or links that correspond to functional subunits in the corresponding complex systems. While most conventional approaches have focused on discovering communities of nodes, some recent studies start partitioning links to find overlapping communities straightforwardly. In this paper, we propose a new quantity function for link community identification in complex networks. Based on this quantity function we formulate the link community partition problem into an integer programming model which allows us to partition a complex network into overlapping communities. We further propose a genetic algorithm for link community detection which can partition a network into overlapping communities without knowing the number of communities. We test our model and algorithm on both artificial networks and real-world networks. The results demonstrate that the model and algorithm are efficient in detecting overlapping community structure in complex networks.","link communities, community detection, community structure"
He2014,"Discovery of communities in complex networks is a fundamental data analysis problem with applications in various domains. While most of the existing approaches have focused on discovering communities of nodes, recent studies have shown the advantages and uses of link community discovery in networks. Generative models provide a promising class of techniques for the identification of modular structures in networks, but most generative models mainly focus on the detection of node communities rather than link communities. In this work, we propose a generative model, which is based on the importance of each node when forming links in each community, to describe the structure of link communities. We proceed to fit the model parameters by taking it as an optimization problem, and solve it using nonnegative matrix factorization. Thereafter, in order to automatically determine the number of communities, we extend the above method by introducing a strategy of iterative bipartition. This extended method not only finds the number of communities all by itself, but also obtains high efficiency, and thus it is more suitable to deal with large and unexplored real networks. We test this approach on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world networks including an application on a large biological network, and compare it with two highly related methods. Results demonstrate the superior performance of our approach over competing methods for the detection of link communities.","link communities, community structure, community detection"

On another front, the classical Darwinian model of natural selection has given way to a more complex view; selection on the “selfish” gene affects organization at all levels, giving rise to parent-offspring, male-female, and intragenomic conflicts of interest.

Jakielski1998,"A consonant cluster is formed by sequential closant articulations. Clusters are one of the last phonetic constructs acquired by children, frequently misarticulated by individuals with disordered speech, most subject to impairment in acquired motor-based neurological disorders, and difficult for second language learners to acquire. No phonetic account of early cluster acquisition has been systematically explored. In the present study, longitudinal prelinguistic and linguistic data from five infants 7-36 months of age were phonetically transcribed. Data were analyzed to evaluate five production hypotheses. Results showed a significant group trend to form babbling and word clusters primarily from singletons in the phonetic inventory within the same utterance/word position. The majority of babbling clusters were produced in medial position, while the majority of word clusters were produced in initial position. A significant number of babbling clusters were homorganic; word clusters also were homorganic, although the trend did not reach statistical significance. In babbling, cluster-plus-vowel co-occurrence patterns showed significant associations. In words, consonant place of articulation was independent of vowel articulatory dimension in cluster-plus-vowel sequences. An index of cluster complexity did not reveal a change in cluster complexity from the beginning to the end of this study. Individual subjects did not show production patterns that differed considerably from the group trends. Overall, findings revealed that production constraints influence cluster acquisition in babbling, and that both production constraints and ambient language effects influence cluster acquisition in words. These findings provide preliminary evidence for a phonetic approach to understanding serial complexity in cluster acquisition.","phonetic complexity"
Popov1996,"A notion and a measure of linguistic complexity introduced earlier (Trifonov, 1990) were originally used for analysis
of nucleotide sequences. This measure was shown to reflect multiplicity of codes (messages) of different natures
superimposed in the sequences. Unlike human language texts, genetic texts are ‘read’ by cellular mechanisms in several
different ways, each time using a different selection of the characters of the same text while skipping others (Trifonov,
1989). Human texts are read in one way only, sequentially and involving all characters (one code). The conceptual sig-
nificance and essence of the idea on the multiplicity of overlapping codes in genetic sequences, as opposed to human
languages, is discussed. The linguistic complexity technique allows a calculation to be made of the structural complexity
of any linear sequence of characters irrespective of whether the text is cognized or presently undeciphered. The texts
(sequences) are compared exclusively from the point of view of their structural complexity with no reference to the
meaning of the texts which is beyond the scope of this article. Results of such a comparison of protein sequences with
various texts, written in English, Italian and Welsh are presented. The human texts are found to be structurally simpler

Patterson2013,"**Background:** Models of ancestral gene order reconstruction have progressively integrated different evolutionary
patterns and processes such as unequal gene content, gene duplications, and implicitly sequence evolution via
reconciled gene trees. These models have so far ignored lateral gene transfer, even though in unicellular organisms
it can have an important confounding effect, and can be a rich source of information on the function of genes
through the detection of transfers of clusters of genes.

**Result:** We report an algorithm together with its implementation, DeCoLT, that reconstructs ancestral genome
organization based on reconciled gene trees which summarize information on sequence evolution, gene
origination, duplication, loss, and lateral transfer. DeCoLT optimizes in polynomial time on the number of
rearrangements, computed as the number of gains and breakages of adjacencies between pairs of genes. We
apply DeCoLT to 1099 gene families from 36 cyanobacteria genomes.

**Conclusion:** DeCoLT is able to reconstruct adjacencies in 35 ancestral bacterial genomes with a thousand gene
families in a few hours, and detects clusters of co-transferred genes. DeCoLT may also be used with any
relationship between genes instead of adjacencies, to reconstruct ancestral interactions, functions or complexes.

summarizing multiple trees. This is especially problematic when accommodating for biological phenomena such as
horizontal gene transfer, incomplete lineage sorting, and hybridization, as well as topological conflict between datasets.
Additionally, researchers may want to combine information from sets of trees that have partially overlapping taxon sets. To
address the problem of analyzing sets of trees with conflicting relationships and partially overlapping taxon sets, we
introduce methods for aligning, synthesizing and analyzing rooted phylogenetic trees within a graph, called a tree
alignment graph (TAG). The TAG can be queried and analyzed to explore uncertainty and conflict. It can also be synthesized
to construct trees, presenting an alternative to supertrees approaches. We demonstrate these methods with two empirical
datasets. In order to explore uncertainty, we constructed a TAG of the bootstrap trees from the Angiosperm Tree of Life
project. Analysis of the resulting graph demonstrates that areas of the dataset that are unresolved in majority-rule
consensus tree analyses can be understood in more detail within the context of a graph structure, using measures
incorporating node degree and adjacency support. As an exercise in synthesis (i.e., summarization of a TAG constructed
from the alignment trees), we also construct a TAG consisting of the taxonomy and source trees from a recent
comprehensive bird study. We synthesized this graph into a tree that can be reconstructed in a repeatable fashion and
where the underlying source information can be updated. The methods presented here are tractable for large scale analyses

Kay1964,"The ""comparative method"" is one of the principal tools of historical linguistics, but it is not the well-defined technique that the name suggests. This paper presents a formalization in terms of elementary propositional logic of one of the most crucial steps in the comparative method, namely, that in which modern derivatives of prehistoric phonemes are recognized. The basic assumption on which the theory rests is that the words of a hypothetical prehistoric language should be constructed in such a way as to minimize the total number of phonemes in the language and of the statements that need to be made to account for the forms of the modern words.
 
The theory is sufficiently specific to provide an algorithm for a computer program. However, the amount of computation rises sharply with any increase in the amount of data to be considered, and with ipresent techniques it is prohibitive even for trivially small data sets. Nevertheless, the theory provides a basis on which more efficient heuristic procedures might be built.","comparative method, cognate detection, cognates, algorithms"

I provide a direct comparison of anthropology datasets with both phenotype and genotype datasets from biology. The anthropology datasets fit the tree model approximately as well as do the genotype data, which is detectably worse than the fit of the phenotype data.

comparison of the modularity algorithms utility for real biological data is scarce. Here we investigate the utility of network
modularity algorithms for the classification of ecological plant communities. Plant community classification by the traditional
approaches requires prior knowledge about the characteristic and differential species, which are derived from a manual inspec-

communities. The use of more restrictive edge definitions significantly increased the accuracy of community detection, that
is, the correspondence between network-based and traditional community classification. Random-walk based modularity
methods yielded slightly better results than approaches based on the modularity function. For the whole network, the aver-
age agreement between the manual classification and the network-based modules is 76% with varying congruence levels
for different communities ranging between 11% and 100%. The network-based approach recovered the known ecological

Lupyan2010,"**Background**

Languages differ greatly both in their syntactic and morphological systems and in the social environments in which they exist. We challenge the view that language grammars are unrelated to social environments in which they are learned and used.

**Methodology/Principal Findings**

We conducted a statistical analysis of >2,000 languages using a combination of demographic sources and the World Atlas of Language Structures— a database of structural language properties. We found strong relationships between linguistic factors related to morphological complexity, and demographic/socio-historical factors such as the number of language users, geographic spread, and degree of language contact. The analyses suggest that languages spoken by large groups have simpler inflectional morphology than languages spoken by smaller groups as measured on a variety of factors such as case systems and complexity of conjugations. Additionally, languages spoken by large groups are much more likely to use lexical strategies in place of inflectional morphology to encode evidentiality, negation, aspect, and possession. Our findings indicate that just as biological organisms are shaped by ecological niches, language structures appear to adapt to the environment (niche) in which they are being learned and used. As adults learn a language, features that are difficult for them to acquire, are less likely to be passed on to subsequent learners. Languages used for communication in large groups that include adult learners appear to have been subjected to such selection. Conversely, the morphological complexity common to languages used in small groups increases redundancy which may facilitate language learning by infants.

**Conclusions/Significance**

We hypothesize that language structures are subjected to different evolutionary pressures in different social environments. Just as biological organisms are shaped by ecological niches, language structures appear to adapt to the environment (niche) in which they are being learned and used. The proposed Linguistic Niche Hypothesis has implications for answering the broad question of why languages differ in the way they do and makes empirical predictions regarding language acquisition capacities of children versus adults.","linguistic complexity, correlational studies, language change, language contact"

Sino-Tibetan languages however, present an additional problem as described
briefly in Matisoff’s criticism of glottochronology above. I return to this now to
explain how it may be dealt with. Since the time of the ancestral Proto-Sino-Tibetan,
most of the ST languages have become increasingly polysyllabic, constructing many
new words by joining two or more monosyllabic words. Mandarin Chinese offers
many of the better-known examples. The word 身體 *shenti* ‘body’ is composed of
*shen* and *ti*, either of which would have occurred alone in Classical Chinese. 42
Similarly the word for ‘ear’, 耳朵 *erduo*, was simple *er* in the Classical language, and [pb]
*duo* meant flower. The problem though, is that different languages paired words
differently in their histories. [...]","compounding, partial cognacy, Sino-Tibetan, Tibeto-Burman"
SatterthweitePhillips2011,"As a brief aside, note that this phenomenon is much less common in IE, though
analogous cases can be made if we consider just phonemes rather than whole
morphemes. For example consider the following Italian : Spanish pairs: *stare : estar*
‘to be’, *studiare : estudiar* ‘to study’, *strella : estrella* ‘star’, *scalare : escalar* ‘to
climb’. The method described above would fail to recognize the s+consonant pairings
in each of these. Thus the revised method given below could also be applied to search
for phoneme matches anywhere in a given word.","partial cognacy, Sino-Tibetan, Indo-European"

In short this means that actual cognate
correspondences might occur in any given syllable, and the method must be updated to
reflect this. [...]
Because we have no a priori reason to indicate which positions the actual
pairs are likely to occur in, all such pairings as shown here must be considered: [pb]
[...]
However, one more adjustment remains, because, as it stands, this method would give
more weight to words with more syllables. [...]
Since we do not want

Maddison1997,"Exploration of the relationship between gene trees and their containing species trees leads to consideration of how to reconstruct species trees from gene trees and of the concept of phylogeny as a cloud of gene histories. When gene copies are sampled from various species, the gene tree relating these copies might disagree with the species phylogeny. This discord can arise from horizontal transfer (including hybridization), lineage sorting, and gene duplication and extinction. Lineage sorting could also be called deep coalescence, the failure of ancestral copies to coalesce (looking backwards in time) into a common ancestral copy until deeper than previous speciation events. These events depend on various factors; for instance, deep coalescence is more likely if the branches of the species tree are short (in generations) and wide (in population size). A similar dependence on process is found in historical biogeography and host-parasite relationships. Each of the processes of discord could yield a different parsimony criterion for reconstructing the species tree from a set of gene trees: with horizontal transfer, choose the species tree that minimizes the number of transfer events; with deep coalescence, choose the tree minimizing the number of extra gene lineages that had to coexist along species lineages; with gene duplication, choose the tree minimizing duplication and/or extinction events. Maximum likelihood methods for reconstructing the species tree are also possible because coalescence theory provides the probability that a particular gene tree would occur given a species tree (with branch lengths and widths specified). In considering these issues, one is provoked to reconsider precisely what is phylogeny. Perhaps it is misleading to view some gene trees as agreeing and other gene trees as disagreeing with the species tree; rather, all of the gene trees are part of the species tree, which can be visualized like a fuzzy statistical distribution, a cloud of gene histories. Alternatively, phylogeny might be (and has been) viewed not as a history of what happened, genetically, but as a history of what could have happened, i.e., a history of changes in the probabilities of inter-breeding.

Page2002,"Ancient gene duplication events have left many traces in vertebrate genomes. Reconciled trees represent the differences between gene family trees and the species phylogeny those genes are sampled from, allowing us to both infer gene duplication events and estimate a species phylogeny from a sample of gene families. We show that analysis of 118 gene families yields a phylogeny of vertebrates largely in agreement with other data. We formulate the problem of locating episodes of gene duplication as a set cover problem: given a species tree in which each node has a set of gene duplications associated with it, the smallest set of species nodes whose union includes all gene duplications specifies the locations of gene duplication episodes. By generating a unique mapping from this cover set we can determine the minimal number of such episodes at each location. When applied to our data, this method reveals a complex history of gene duplications in vertebrate evolution that does not conform to the ""2R"" hypothesis.","gene tree reconciliation, reconciliation"
Maurits2014,"The ordering of subject, verb, and object is one of the fundamental
components of the syntax of natural languages. The distribution
of basic word orders across the world’s languages is highly non-
uniform, with the majority of languages being either subject-
object-verb (SOV) or subject-verb-object (SVO). Explaining this fact
using psychological accounts of language acquisition or processing
requires understanding how the present distribution has resulted
from ancestral distributions and the rates of change between
orders. We show that Bayesian phylogenetics can provide quantita-
tive answers to three important questions: how word orders are
likely to change over time, which word orders were dominant his-
torically, and whether strong inferences about the origins of syntax
can be drawn from modern languages. We find that SOV to SVO
change is more common than the reverse and VSO to SVO change is
more common than VSO to SOV, and that if the seven language
families we consider share a common ancestor then that common
ancestor likely had SOV word order, but also that there are limits on
how confidently we can make inferences about ancestral word or-
der based on modern-day observations. These results shed new
light on old questions from historical linguistics and provide clear
targets for psychological explanations of word-order distributions.","syntax, language evolution"

Redelings2005,"We describe a novel model and algorithm for simultaneously estimating multiple molecular sequence alignments
and the phylogenetic trees that relate the sequences. Unlike current techniques that base phylogeny estimates on a single
estimate of the alignment, we take alignment uncertainty into account by considering all possible alignments. Furthermore,
because the alignment and phylogeny are constructed simultaneously, a guide tree is not needed. This sidesteps the problem
in which alignments created by progressive alignment are biased toward the guide tree used to generate them. Joint estimation
also allows us to model rate variation between sites when estimating the alignment and to use the evidence in shared
insertion/deletions (indels) to group sister taxa in the phylogeny. Our indel model makes use of affine gap penalties and
considers indels of multiple letters. We make the simplifying assumption that the indel process is identical on all branches.
As a result, the probability of a gap is independent of branch length. We use a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
method to sample from the posterior of the joint model, estimating the most probable alignment and tree and their support
simultaneously. We describe a new MCMC transition kernel that improves our algorithm’s mixing efficiency, allowing
the MCMC chains to converge even when started from arbitrary alignments. Our software implementation can estimate
alignment uncertainty and we describe a method for summarizing this uncertainty in a single plot.","multiple sequence alignment, Bayesian approaches, phylogenetic reconstruction"

Dellert2014,"Recently, cross-linguistic polysemies have been discovered as a valuable resource for lexical
semantics. Co-occurrences of gloss lexemes in multilingual wordlists can be summarized into
polysemy networks, a new type of semantic resource. In this work, this relatively new paradigm
is applied to an entire dictionary database, resulting in a polysemy network that spans more
than 30,000 German lexemes.

Within computational historical linguistics, polysemy networks have been discussed as a possible
computational model of semantic change, where short paths in such networks are expected
to express possible semantic shifts. To assess the validity of the polysemy network for this
purpose, I apply it to the task of finding cognate candidates, i.e. words in related languages
which might have developed from the same word in a common ancestor language. On a test set
of cognates shared between Finnish and Hungarian, I investigate the number of true cognate
pairs whose translations are connected in the polysemy network by shortest paths of different
lengths. The results are very promising, providing evidence that cross-linguistic polysemies are
indeed closely connected to plausible semantic shifts.","colexification, polysemy, network"

This evolved into a theory of lexicostatistics which claimed to justify a technique for estimating the time of separation of two related languages and techniques for classifying languages according to their genetic relationships. This theory has come under sharp attack, due mainly to the simplicstic model involved and also to the degree of variability of the estimates produced. In this study we construct a more refined theory based on a mathematical linguistics model of word-meaning relationship. This model is not subject to the criticisms of the earlier model, but analytit and computer simulation studies show that the lexicostatistic properties hold with respect to this theory. To apply some of the refinements of thsi theory, an extensive data processing project is reported, involving the Indo-European languages. A number of related problems are discussed, with emphasis on the applicability of the stochastic processes approach.","language model, lexical change, lexicostatistics, modeling"

Ellison2006,"For example, the *neighbourhood activation

relative frequency of words in the neighbourhood

the target if their Levenstein (1965) edit distance
from the target is one. The more frequent the word
is, the greater its likelihood of replacing the target.","neighbourhood activation model, Levenshtein distance, edit distance, confusion probability"

The result is a language-specific similarity score between all words in a sample.

The interesting aspect of this approach is that it yields one of the best Dyen trees I have ever seen so far.

The authors also mention that it should be possible to use their system for cognate detection, which is something one should definitely look into at some point in the future.

Krishnamurti1983,"If a sound change has lexically diffused without completing its course, one finds that
among the lexical items qualified for the change, some have already changed (c), others
have remained unchanged (u), and still others show variant forms (u/c). When such a
change has affected a group of genetically related languages, the consequent comparative
pattern u-ulc-c can be used to set up subrelations among languages. In this paper,
we draw on data from six languages belonging to the South-Central subfamily of Dra-
vidian, with reference to an atypical sound change called 'apical displacement'. There
are 63 etymologies which qualify for the study. A total of 945 possible binary-labeled
trees fall into six types for the six languages under study. In terms of our postulates,
that tree is the best which scores the lowest m, i.e. the minimum number of independent
instances of change needed to account for the u-c-o (o = no cognate) pattern of a given
entry. Each of the 63 entries has been applied to the possible 945 trees, and the trees
have been scored for the value m by computer. The one tree which scored the lowest
(71 points) is identical with the traditionally established tree for these languages. This
paper shows that: (a) one shared innovation is sufficient to give genetic subrelations
among languages, within the framework of the theory of lexical diffusion; (b) unchanged
cognates are as important as changed cognates in giving differential scores for possible
trees; and (c) the notion of shared innovation can be further refined within the theory

lexical inventories of languages, viewed as entire systems, evolve? Is the rate
of evolution of the lexicon contingent upon historical factors or is it driven
by regularities, perhaps to do with universals of cognition and social inter-
action? We address these questions using the Google Books N-Gram Corpus
as a source of data and relative entropy as a measure of changes in the fre-

similar rates of change, but only at timescales of at least around five decades.
At shorter timescales, the rate of change is highly variable and differs between
languages. Major societal transformations as well as catastrophic events such
as wars lead to increased change in frequency distributions, whereas stability
in society has a dampening effect on lexical evolution.","lexical change, stability, lexical replacement"
Magee2014,"The scientific enterprise depends critically on the preservation of and open access to published data. This basic tenet applies acutely to phylogenies (estimates of evolutionary relationships among species). Increasingly, phylogenies are estimated from increasingly large, genome-scale datasets using increasingly complex statistical methods that require increasing levels of expertise and computational investment. Moreover, the resulting phylogenetic data provide an explicit historical perspective that critically informs research in a vast and growing number of scientific disciplines. One such use is the study of changes in rates of lineage diversification (speciation – extinction) through time. As part of a meta-analysis in this area, we sought to collect phylogenetic data (comprising nucleotide sequence alignment and tree files) from 217 studies published in 46 journals over a 13-year period. We document our attempts to procure those data (from online archives and by direct request to corresponding authors), and report results of analyses (using Bayesian logistic regression) to assess the impact of various factors on the success of our efforts. Overall, complete phylogenetic data for of these studies are effectively lost to science. Our study indicates that phylogenetic data are more likely to be deposited in online archives and/or shared upon request when: (1) the publishing journal has a strong data-sharing policy; (2) the publishing journal has a higher impact factor, and; (3) the data are requested from faculty rather than students. Importantly, our survey spans recent policy initiatives and infrastructural changes; our analyses indicate that the positive impact of these community initiatives has been both dramatic and immediate.

Mace1994,"Cross-cultural comparison is a common method of testing hypotheses regarding the co-evolution of elements of cultures or of the adaptiveness of a cultural practice to some aspect of the environment. It has long been recognized, however, that cultures are not independent but rather may share many cultural elements by virtue of common ancestry and proximity. Attempts to address this issue, known as Galton's problem, range from statistically removing confounding variables to using a standard sample of ''independent cultures.'' We show here that when testing any hypothesis of co-evolution one should not attempt to identify independent cultures or to create them statistically. Rather, cross-cultural comparative studies must be based upon the identification of independent events of cultural change. Once this principle is applied, it becomes apparent that it is in fact groups of closely related cultures that are potentially the most informative for testing cross-cultural hypotheses. Constructing phylogenies of cultures and placing upon them independent instances of cultural elements' arising or changing is an essential part of this task.","cultural evolution, common origin, statistical independency, correction, co-evolution"
Szoellosi2015,"This article reviews the various models that have been used to describe the relationships between gene trees and species trees. Molecular phylogeny has focused mainly on improving models for the reconstruction of gene trees based on sequence alignments. Yet, most phylogeneticists seek to reveal the history of species. Although the histories of genes and species are tightly linked, they are seldom identical, because genes duplicate, are lost or horizontally transferred, and because alleles can co-exist in populations for periods that may span several speciation events. Building models describing the relationship between gene and species trees can thus improve the reconstruction of gene trees when a species tree is known, and vice-versa. Several approaches have been proposed to solve the problem in one direction or the other, but in general neither gene trees nor species trees are known. Only a few studies have attempted to jointly infer gene trees and species trees. These models account for gene duplication and loss, transfer or incomplete lineage sorting. Some of them consider several types of events together, but none exists currently that considers the full repertoire of processes that generate gene trees along the species tree. Simulations as well as empirical studies on genomic data show that combining gene tree-species tree models with models of sequence evolution improves gene tree reconstruction. In turn, these better gene trees provide a more reliable basis for studying genome evolution or reconstructing ancestral chromosomes and ancestral gene sequences. We predict that gene tree-species tree methods that can deal with genomic data sets will be instrumental to advancing our understanding of genomic evolution.","gene tree reconciliation, lateral gene transfer, phylogenetic network"
Kassian2010,"The paper is a thematical follow-up to the refinements of the lexicostatistical method sug-
gested in @Starostin2010 [Starostin G. 2010]. It discusses the issue of synonymity/polysemy, a well-known
obstacle in the compilation of Swadesh wordlists for various languages, and presents a list of
both syntactic/semantic contexts and explanatory notes that could help reduce the ambiguity
issue in the creation and quantitative analysis of such wordlists. The notes and contexts are
partially based on linguistic tradition and partially on theoretical and/or pragmatic consid-
erations, some of which are stated explicitly.","basic vocabulary, basic level concepts, semantic similarity, semantic specification"
Kassian2010,"


1) In all cases, as is prescribed by the standard procedure, we advocate the choice of the
most stylistically *basic*, *neutral*, and *unmarked* word, uncumbered by either pragmatic connotations or strongly emphasized additional, “extra” semantic features. [...]


2) The word also has to be encountered in unbound use, not constrained exclusively to spe-
cific idiomatic constructions or compound forms. [...]


3) A frequent source of synonymity and, therefore, confusion concerning the Swadesh
wordlist is the phenomenon of suppletion within a paradigm. Because proper grammatical
suppletion is sometimes hard to distinguish from lexical variation (e.g., the use of special col-
lective forms of nouns; aspectual forms of verbs, etc.), it is strongly recommended to avoid in-
cluding suppletive stems as synonyms altogether. One should attempt to determine the most
unmarked, morphologically unencumbered stem, which typically corresponds to such mor-
phological values as singular number (for nouns), positive degree of comparison (for adjec-
tives), 3rd person / present tense / singular subject or object of action (for verbs); [...]


4) The list is generally anthropocentric, meaning that most of the anatomic terms and ac-
tion verbs (such as ‘sit’, ‘lie’, ‘eat’, etc.) are to be taken as human body parts and actions; e.g.,
the wordlist for Modern Russian should contain *рот* ‘mouth (of a human)’, but not *пасть*
‘mouth (of an animal)’, and the wordlist for German should contain *essen* ‘to eat (of a human)’,
but not *fressen* ‘to eat (of an animal)’. [...]


5) Many of the items on the Swadesh list form functional antonymous pairs, e.g., ‘big :
small’, ‘black : white’, ‘man : woman’, or groups of two or three elements with tight semantic
connections, e.g., ‘sun : moon’, ‘eat : drink’, ‘sit : stand : lie’ etc. It is very useful to seek out
syntactic contexts that contrast these elements, since otherwise we increase the risk of a non-
basic term creeping in. [...]


6) One of the cases where synonymity is unavoidable is when we deal with a transitional
stage in language history, during which an older word is gradually being “ushered out” by a
more recent replacement [...].

[pb] 

7) Synonimity must also be considered (but can sometimes be avoided) in dealing with
the phenomenon of *compound* forms found on the list, consisting of two or more root mor-
phemes; this is especially typical of “monosyllabic” languages that frequently recur to com-
pounding in order to avoid excessive homonymy (e.g., Sino-Tibetan, Kradai, Abkhaz-Adyghe),
but in small doses can be found almost anywhere.


Most of these criteria — not always, but more frequently than not — help to single out the
most *statistically frequent* of the possible equivalents. The criterion of frequency of use cannot
be construed as a strong demand, but it may be related to the idea of writing down the
equivalent that “first springs to mind” when dealing with an informant, or the one that is
listed before all others in a context-less dictionary (unless, of course, it lists all the synonyms in
alphabetic order).","basic vocabulary, semantic specification"

on the other, together with the intensity level to which actors show their features. The main
contribution of our work is twofold. First, we develop a methodological approach that takes
into account the underlying multivariate dependence among groups of actors. The idea is
that positions in a network could be dened on the basis of the similar intensity levels that
the actors exhibit in expressing some features, instead of just considering relationships that
actors hold with each others. Second, we propose a new clustering procedure that exploits
the potentiality of copula functions, a mathematical instrument for the modelization of the
stochastic dependence structure. Our clustering algorithm can be applied both to binary and
real-valued matrices. We validate it with simulations and applications to real-world data.","clustering, complex network, copula function, positional analysis, weighted bipartite network"

be less amenable, when contrasted to warm and humid ecologies,
to the development of languages with phonemic tone, especially
complex tone. This prediction is supported by data from two large
independently coded databases representing 3,700+ languages.
Languages with complex tonality have generally not developed
in very cold or otherwise desiccated climates, in accordance with
the physiologically based predictions. The predicted global geo-

Mazaudon1988,"It is generally assumed that sound changes target classes of features, rather than phonemes. Here I
shall argue that while this is true of segmental features, tone changes (with one exception) do not take
place by feature. This leads us to claim that tones should not be defined in terms of features, but instead
should be viewed as indivisible units. If the widely held view were correct that tones should be
represented by matrices of features (and that contour tones consist of sequences of such matrices), we
would expect historical change to affect tones AS SERIES , as it does in the case of consonants. The
extensive literature and my own comparative field work on the evolution of tonal systems in Asian
languages show that tones typically evolve independently of one another. The one exception occurs
when the merger of two (rarely three) series of initial consonants leads to the phonologization of a pitch
feature on a vowel. In this case, analyses such as Yip (1988) and Clements (1983), where one feature
represents the proto-tonal opposition and another feature represents the feature contributed by the
consonant, can be maintained. However, once the tone system is fully constituted, each tone follows its
own path and this individual evolution constitutes a counter-example for a feature analysis of purely
tonal systems.","tone, tone language, sound change, distinctive features"

Creanza2015,"Worldwide patterns of genetic variation are driven by human
demographic history. Here, we test whether this demographic

distinguish meaning between words in languages—to those it has
left on genes. We analyze, jointly and in parallel, phoneme inven-
tories from 2,082 worldwide languages and microsatellite polymor-
phisms from 246 worldwide populations. On a global scale, both
genetic distance and phonemic distance between populations are
significantly correlated with geographic distance. Geographically
close language pairs share significantly more phonemes than distant
language pairs, whether or not the languages are closely related. The
regional geographic axes of greatest phonemic differentiation corre-
spond to axes of genetic differentiation, suggesting that there is
a relationship between human dispersal and linguistic variation.
However, the geographic distribution of phoneme inventory sizes
does not follow the predictions of a serial founder effect during
human expansion out of Africa. Furthermore, although geographi-
cally isolated populations lose genetic diversity via genetic drift,
phonemes are not subject to drift in the same way: within a given
geographic radius, languages that are relatively isolated exhibit
more variance in number of phonemes than languages with many
neighbors. This finding suggests that relatively isolated languages
are more susceptible to phonemic change than languages with
many neighbors. Within a language family, phoneme evolution
along genetic, geographic, or cognate-based linguistic trees predicts
similar ancestral phoneme states to those predicted from ancient
sources. More genetic sampling could further elucidate the relative
roles of vertical and horizontal transmission in phoneme evolution.","phoneme, phonemic variation, phonetic variation, language variation, phoneme inventory, genetic diversity"

elements through founder effects or drift, or do languages with
more speakers lose features due to a process of simplification?

have higher rates of gain of new words whereas smaller populations
have higher rates of word loss. These results show that demographic

sequence alignments. I point out the way in which current computer programs for multiple sequence alignment relate to these criteria, noting
that each of them usually implements only one criterion. This explains the apparent dissatisfaction with computerized sequence alignment
in phylogenetics, as any program that truly tried to produce alignments based on homology would need to simultaneously optimize all of
the criteria.","sequence alignment, multiple sequence alignment, homology, cognacy"

Dogan2013,"Identifying shared sequence segments along amino acid sequences generally requires a collection of closely related
proteins, most often curated manually from the sequence datasets to suit the purpose at hand. Currently developed
statistical methods are strained, however, when the collection contains remote sequences with poor alignment to the rest,
or sequences containing multiple domains. In this paper, we propose a completely unsupervised and automated method to
identify the shared sequence segments observed in a diverse collection of protein sequences including those present in a
smaller fraction of the sequences in the collection, using a combination of sequence alignment, residue conservation
scoring and graph-theoretical approaches. Since shared sequence fragments often imply conserved functional or structural
attributes, the method produces a table of associations between the sequences and the identified conserved regions that
can reveal previously unknown protein families as well as new members to existing ones. We evaluated the biological
relevance of the method by clustering the proteins in gold standard datasets and assessing the clustering performance in
comparison with previous methods from the literature. We have then applied the proposed method to a genome wide
dataset of 17793 human proteins and generated a global association map to each of the 4753 identified conserved regions.
Investigations on the major conserved regions revealed that they corresponded strongly to annotated structural domains.
This suggests that the method can be useful in predicting novel domains on protein sequences.","partial cognacy, cognate detection, partial cognate detection, clique, network"

Boc2010,"Discovering the origin of the Indo-European (IE) language family is one
of the most intensively studied problems in historical linguistics. Gray and Atkinson
[6] inferred a phylogenetic tree (i.e., additive tree or X-tree [2]) of the IE family, using
bayesian inference and rate-smoothing algorithms, based on the 87 Indo-European
language data set collected by Dyen et al. [5]. When conducting their classification
study, Gray and Atkinson assumed that the evolution of languages was strictly
divergent and the frequency of borrowing (i.e., horizontal transmission of individual
words) was very low. As consequence, their results suggested a predominantly tree-
like pattern of the IE language evolution. In our opinion, only a network model
can adequately represent the evolution of the IE languages. We propose to apply a
method of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) detection [8] to reconstruct phylogenetic
network depicting the evolution of the IE language family.","Indo-European, phylogenetic reconstruction, network, phylogenetic network"

this paper is set in the context of scoring
learners’ responses to listening comprehension items included in a placement test

on a corpus of over 3000 responses to 17

falsely identified as misspelt or the spellchecker is unable to identify the intended

hypothesis is tested against diachronic data from Indo-Aryan languages, and, in
spite of a number of counterexamples, a correlation is found. In addition, it is
shown how these data can be applied to semantic reconstruction, and a scenario

Swadesh1959,"These notions have led to the following
technique of locating cognates, which the author has seen used with great saving
of time and increased thoroughness. Word-lists for a set of languages are placed
side by side, and all apparent cognates of the same meaning are put on a slip of
paper; if no cognates are observed, separate slips are made for each word in each
language. A carbon copy of the slips is retained in the original numerical order as
a finder list; since the word lists are in topical order an alphabetical index by
meanings is needed for locating the slips when needed. The originals are regrouped
to bring together all those of related meaning, and cognates thus found are joined
[pb]
by stapling the slips together. Sometimes different semantic groupings are tried
until all the possibilities have been examined. Tentative reconstructions of phonetic
form are written in for each set of cognates. The slips are refiled according to the
phonetic form of the reconstructions, allowing the comparativist to study the
correctness of the phonologic equations and also sometimes revealing additional
cognates with unexpected meanings. Corrections in cognate identification and
reconstruction are made whenever the accumulating information requires it. The
file prepared for one linguistic group may be collated with another one to build
up broader and broader comparisons. The technique we have described could be
easily adapted to use with the simpler types of filing machinery, with the com-
parativist intervening at the critical points.","Swadesh list, word list, basic vocabulary, cognate detection, comparative method"

mechanisms that drive this evolution are not well understood. Against a baseline
that communication variants spread in a population following neutral evolutionary dynamics (also known as drift models), we tested the role of two
cultural selection models: coordination- and content-biased. We constructed a
parametrized mixed probabilistic model of the spread of communicative
variants in four 8-person laboratory micro-societies engaged in a simple

setting includes an egocentric bias and a content bias, suggesting that participants retained their own previously used communicative variants unless they

Dybo2008,"One major reason for this is historical: it is no big secret that the Indo- European family
was recognized primarily on the basis of the amazing similarity between the paradig-
matic systems of Old Indian and classic European lan- guages like Greek or Latin, and,
since the general methodology of comparat- ive linguistics grew out of working with
Indo-European languages, morpho- logical comparison, by the very force of tradition,
is still held in high esteem and frequently suggested as a universal means for establishing
relationship.","basic vocabulary, grammar, proof of relationship"
Dybo2008,"Another reason lies in the intuitive sphere.
Morphology (and gram- mar in general) is traditionally seen as the «skeleton» of the language, its
main constituent which, in comparison with lexics that «comes and goes», is relatively stable and
thus far more valid for the first stage of compari- son. Thus, if the languages compared do not seem
to share much common morphology, but are nevertheless quite close lexically, for many linguists
the obvious explanation will be that the languages are not related, but show traces of extensive
contacts («convergence»).","basic vocabulary, grammar, proof of relationship"
Dybo2008,"From a purely synchronic, structuralist point of view such an under- standing of morphology
is quite reasonable. And it is most certainly true that regular paradigmatic correspondences
in morphology are necessarily indicative of genetic relationship (with the possible exception
of creole and pigin languages, whose genetic status is still debatable). But is the re-verse also
true — that genetically related languages absolutely have to share common morphology?
And if not, which cases of genetic relation- ship would be expected to be «morphologically
unprovable»?","basic vocabulary, proof of relationship, grammar"
Dybo2008,"An interesting test — which we refrain from performing in details since its results are all too
predictable — would be to take, for instance, 00 of the most frequent grammatical morphemes
reconstructed for Proto-Indo-Euro- pean and see how well they have been preserved in such
modern Indo-Euro- pean languages as Hindi, French, or English. For the latter in particular,
we are afraid, the results would be catastrophic (just a few minor traces, such as the -s marker
for nominal plurals, -t in irregularly formed past participles, etc.). On the other hand, if we
take the Swadesh list of 100 most basic lexical items, it seems to fare infinitely better: over 90
% of the corresponding Eng- lish items can be traced back to their Indo-European ancestors,
and, what’s more important, at least a good third of them can even be shown to have possessed
the exact same meaning in the protolanguage as they do in mod- ern English, including body
parts (‛eye’, ‛ear’, ‛nose’, ‛tongue’, ‛foot’, etc.), numerals (‛one’, ‛two’), nature terms (‛sun’,
‛star’), pronouns, verbs, etc. In this particular case at least, «morphology» seems to be a far
shakier means to ascertain genetic relationship than basic lexicon.","basic vocabulary, proof of relationship, genetic relationship, grammar"
Dybo2008,"The bottomline here is as follows: we know for a fact that a language’s system of morpholo-
gical markers can undergo an overwhelming collapse over a relatively short period of time,
and frequently does. Thus, it hardly took more than a few hundred years for the elaborate
nominal morpho- logy of Classical Latin to be reduced to almost nothing. Chinese, over a
period of one millennium, underwent a transformation from an essen- tially «Sino-Tibetan»
type language to an «Austro-Thai» type language, even though genetically its ties certainly
lie with the former. The basic lex- icon, however, of both Chinese and Latin has had a much
higher rate of survival [STAROSTIN 2000a: 256]; and, although high-scale borrowings can
occasionally speed up lexical replacement, to our knowledge, there is not a single historically
attested case of the Swadesh 100-wordlist losing even a quarter of its constituents over a one
thousand year period.","basic vocabulary, genetic relationship, grammar, proof of relationship"
Dybo2008,"A serious reconstruction of Proto-Indo-European morphology, particularly paradigmatic mor-
phology, would have been unthinkable without access to language data that significantly de-
creases the chronological distance from attested languages to their reconstructed ancestor —
which is exactly the case for Altaic and Sino-Caucasian, where the overwhelming majority
of information is gained from modern languages.","proof of relationship, genetic relationship, grammar, basic vocabulary"
Dybo2008,"This means that the best results will be attained if (a) cal- culations are performed on the
material of entire language groups rather than isolated representatives; (b) at least a provi-
sionary set of phonetic correspondences has been established for the compared units, based
on an extensive study of the compared vocabularies in their entirety.","genetic relationship, basic vocabulary, genetic classification"
Dybo2008,"The question of whether rela- tionship is best demonstrated through morphology or through
lexics is exactly that — a question (albeit one that, we believe, has been fully an- swered
above); but when it comes to regularity of phonetic corresponden- ces — the pillar of com-
parative linguistics — there can be no second opi- nion on the issue: correspondences must
be regular. That said, before pro- ceeding to anything else, an understanding must be reached

Teeter1963,"All of lexicostatistics operates with a standard diagnostic list of glosses, to which it attaches
forms from different languages. These are then scored as similar or dissimilar, by various
techniques, and the percentages of similar and dissimilar items thus derived supply the lexi-
costatistician with the basic data from which he reasons. The main attractions of the method,
aside from the hope of providing dates, are the ease of gathering the necessary wordlists and
the anticipation that it can provide a quick route to knowledge of the course of linguistic
history. As one linguist has expressed it, there is among lexicostatisticians ’the expectation
that it [the method] makes comparative results possible via a shortcut that avoids the fuss
and bother of the comparative method of reconstruction by simply counting similarities in
forms sharing the same gloss in a brief but particular lexical sample’.[cf. Voegelin 1962,

difficulty of comparing grammars is not to be taken lightly - if indeed it can make good this
claim.","lexicostatistics, basic vocabulary, validity"

  * *Plausibility.*  Prefer the most plausible solution for both the protosystem and the sequence  of changes.

There is no analogue in morphological change to regular sound change. **Regularity**
is, however, taken into account in phonological reconstruction not by the core recon­struction procedure  (step 6) but in the correspondence  sets which are the input to this
core reconstruction  procedure. The set of corresponding phonemes is established by
extracting phonemes  from  the same relative position in (tentative) cognate words or
morphemes,  that is, in words that are similar enough in both phonological form and
meaning to be considered possible reflexes of the same original  word. The compara­tive method is applied to such sets of phonemes  only if they recur in numbers of cog­nate  sets. This  recurrence follows from  the basic  regularity  of  sound change.  Mor­phological  change  is not  regular  in the  same  sense,  and  therefore  does  not  lead  to
recurrent correspondences between tentative morphs.","morphological reconstruction, morphological change, phonological change, sound change, mutation"

Koch1996,"The distribution  of co­allomorphs may be altered,  one allomorph  replacing  another
in certain contexts. This replacement results in the creation  of new morph combina­ tions,  and may cause the elimination  of certain  allomorphs  and hence  lead  to a re­duction in the number of allomorphs  of a particular morpheme.  If all but  one  allo­
morph are eliminated, the result is the total loss of allomorphy, and the achievement
of the ideal of one meaning being expressed  by just one form. Here it is useful to dis­tinguish between allomorph redistribution in a lexical stem and in affixes. (I shall con­fine my discussion to inflectional  affixes. Much the same principles apply to deriva­
tional affixes  and to modificatory morphological  processes.)

Reduction of allomorphy in stems is traditionally called paradigm levelling  (4.4).
In fact, reduction of allomorphy is more likely to take place within inflectional para­digms than across  derivationally  related  forms. Within paradigms, levelling  affects
(sub)paradigms that are more closely related in meaning before those that are less
closely  related  in meaning (Bybee  1985:  64 f). Thus levelling may  affect  the gram­matical words expressing all the person­number combinations in a given tense before [pb]
it affects  other tenses,  or all tenses of one aspect before  other  aspects,  or all cases  in
the plural before  similar cases  in the singular, etc. The expanding  allomorph may be
either the newer  one  (typically created  by  sound change)  or the older  one.  It is not
possible  to give a general  rule which predicts  which allomorph  will prevail in such
levelling. A number of factors have been suggested. A combination  of several factors
may be responsible  in many cases.","analogy, allomorphic change, paradigm levelling"
Koch1996,"1. Paradigm frequency:  The variant occurring in the most forms in the  paradigm prevails.

Thus the plural allomorph prevails in words  typically used in the plural in Frisian,  where  'tooth'/'teeth' kies  /kjizz­en  is replaced by  kjizze /kjizze­n  (Tiersma 1982). Similarly, in Polish place names, the stem  allomorph of the local cases has penetrated to other word forms of the paradigm (Mariczak 1957­58:  396ff.).

the boundary is shifted  outward, the new morph is bigger  than the old and includes
phonic material  that was formerly part of another morph. If the boundary is  shifted
inward the new morph is smaller than the old, and material that was formerly part of
the morph now belongs to another morph, or constitutes a morph of its own.","morphological change, morphological reconstruction"
Koch1996,"The mechanism that effects boundary change is reanalysis. The motivation for re­analysis is that an alternative analysis becomes possible and more plausible to speak­

relevant morphs, the meaning of the morph in other combinations may have changed,
or the morph may have disappeared  from  other  environments.","reanalysis, morphological change"

free  word to bound clitic, from  clitic to affix,  or from  affix  to simply a part of anoth­er morph.  (The  change in status from  a free  lexical morpheme to a free  grammatical

morph and loses  its morphic status altogether.  This proceeds  by means  of boundary
deletion,  which has been  discussed in 5.1. This kind of change  in status of a morph
has been called  demorphologization  by Hopper:  ""When  a morpheme  loses its gram­matical­semantic  contribution  to  a  word,  but  retains  some remnant  of  its  original

there  are  documented instances (though relatively rare)  of  the  the  reordering  of  af­fixes  within words.","morphological change, re-ordering"

among competing selective demands exert the only brake upon perfection;
nonoptimality is thereby rendered as a result of adaptation as well. We criticize this
approach and attempt to reassert a competing notion (long popular in continental
Europe) that organisms must be analyzed as integrated wholes, with baupläne so
constrained by phyletic heritage, pathways of development, and general architecture
that the constraints themselves become more interesting and more important in
delimiting pathways of change than the selective force that may mediate change when it
occurs. We fault the adaptationist programme for its failure to distinguish current utility
from reasons for origin (male tyrannosaurs may have used their diminutive front legs to
titillate female partners, but this will not explain why they got so small); for its
unwillingness to consider alternatives to adaptive stories; for its reliance upon
plausibility alone as a criterion for accepting speculative tales; and for its failure to
consider adequately such competing themes as random fixation of alleles, production of
nonadaptive structures by developmental correlation with selected features (allometry,
pleiotropy, material compensation, mechanically forced correlation), the separability of

regulative stipulation motivated by the presumed necessity that science achieves logical validity
in what can be said (hypothesized) about the Earth. Regulative principles, including simplicity,
actualism and gradualism, are imposed a priori to insure valid inductive reasoning. This
distinction lies at the heart of the catastrophist versus uniformitarian debates in the early nine-

inference in which hypotheses are generated retroductively. This latter form of logical inference
remains relevant to modern science, while the outmoded notions of induction that warranted the

genera, translations of words reveal cases where a particular language uses a single pol-

Beckstette2006,"**Background**

In biological sequence analysis, position specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) are widely used to represent sequence motifs in nucleotide as well as amino acid sequences. Searching with PSSMs in complete genomes or large sequence databases is a common, but computationally expensive task.

**Results**

We present a new non-heuristic algorithm, called ESAsearch, to efficiently find matches of PSSMs in large databases. Our approach preprocesses the search space, e.g., a complete genome or a set of protein sequences, and builds an enhanced suffix array that is stored on file. This allows the searching of a database with a PSSM in sublinear expected time. Since ESAsearch benefits from small alphabets, we present a variant operating on sequences recoded according to a reduced alphabet. We also address the problem of non-comparable PSSM-scores by developing a method which allows the efficient computation of a matrix similarity threshold for a PSSM, given an E-value or a p-value. Our method is based on dynamic programming and, in contrast to other methods, it employs lazy evaluation of the dynamic programming matrix. We evaluated algorithm ESAsearch with nucleotide PSSMs and with amino acid PSSMs. Compared to the best previous methods, ESAsearch shows speedups of a factor between 17 and 275 for nucleotide PSSMs, and speedups up to factor 1.8 for amino acid PSSMs. Comparisons with the most widely used programs even show speedups by a factor of at least 3.8. Alphabet reduction yields an additional speedup factor of 2 on amino acid sequences compared to results achieved with the 20 symbol standard alphabet. The lazy evaluation method is also much faster than previous methods, with speedups of a factor between 3 and 330.

**Conclusion**

Our analysis of ESAsearch reveals sublinear runtime in the expected case, and linear runtime in the worst case for sequences not shorter than | A|m + m - 1, where m is the length of the PSSM and A a finite alphabet. In practice, ESAsearch shows superior performance over the most widely used programs, especially for DNA sequences. The new algorithm for accurate on-the-fly calculations of thresholds has the potential to replace formerly used approximation approaches. Beyond the algorithmic contributions, we provide a robust, well documented, and easy to use software package, implementing the ideas and algorithms presented in this manuscript.

Zhang1997,"Adaptive evolution at the molecular level can be studied by detecting convergent and parallel evolution at the amino acid sequence level. For a set of homologous protein sequences, the ancestral amino acids at all interior nodes of the phylogenetic tree of the proteins can be statistically inferred. The amino acid sites that have experienced convergent or parallel changes on independent evolutionary lineages can then be identified by comparing the amino acids at the beginning and end of each lineage. At present, the efficiency of the methods of ancestral sequence inference in identifying convergent and parallel changes is unknown. More seriously, when we identify convergent or parallel changes, it is unclear whether these changes are attributable to random chance. For these reasons, claims of convergent and parallel evolution at the amino acid sequence level have been disputed. We have conducted computer simulations to assess the efficiencies, of the parsimony and Bayesian methods of ancestral sequence inference in identifying convergent and parallel-change sites. Our results showed that the Bayesian method performs better than the parsimony method in identifying parallel changes, and both methods are inefficient in identifying convergent changes. However, the Bayesian method is recommended for estimating the number of convergent-change sites because it gives a conservative estimate. We have developed statistical tests for examining whether the observed numbers of convergent and parallel changes are due to random chance. As an example, we reanalyzed the stomach lysozyme sequences of foregut fermenters and found that parallel evolution is statistically significant, whereas convergent evolution is not well supported.","adaptive evolution, convergent evolution, parallel evolution"

infer the reason for the person’s ostensive act, creating a context of interpretation
in which the communicator’s ostensive act “makes sense”, and thereby inferring
the communicative and informative intention of the person. Language is not
necessary for communication in this view, but develops as speakers use linguistic
patterns over and over again to constrain the addressee’s creation of the context of
interpretation. Speakers choose which aspects to constrain the interpretation of,
and language forms conventionalize from frequent repetition. As constraining the
interpretation requires more effort than not constraining it in that way, it must
be important to the speakers to constrain that particular aspect of the meaning,
otherwise they would not put in the extra effort. Logically, then, the forms that
do conventionalize must have been motivated by the cognition and culture of the
speakers of the language when they conventionalized, even though over time the
motivation is often lost and the form continues to be used only due to convention

Lewis2001,"Evolutionary biologists have adopted simple likelihood models for purposes of estimating ancestral states and evaluating character independence on specified phylogenies; however, for purposes of estimating phylogenies by using discrete morphological data, maximum parsimony remains the only option. This paper explores the possibility of using standard, well-behaved Markov models for estimating morphological phylogenies (including branch lengths) under the likelihood criterion. An important modification of standard Markov models involves making the likelihood conditional on characters being variable, because constant characters are absent in morphological data sets. Without this modification, branch lengths are often overestimated, resulting in potentially serious biases in tree topology selection. Several new avenues of research are opened by an explicitly model-based approach to phylogenetic analysis of discrete morphological data, including combined-data likelihood analyses (morphology + sequence data), likelihood ratio tests, and Bayesian analyses. ","ancestral states, morphological characters, multi-state models, maximum likelihood"
Lewis2001,"Rather than propose
a new model, my purpose here is to examine the consequences of applying this type
of model to morphological character data
and to describe modications needed to accommodate the peculiarities of discrete mor-
phological data sets. I will hereafter use the
acronym Mk to refer to this family of models
(where the “M” stands for “Markov” and “k”
refers to the number of states observed). The
Mk model is a generalized JC69 model, the
latter representing the special case of k=4
(the JC69 model could thus be referred to
as the M4 model). The Mk model assumes
that a lineage is always in one of k
possible
states (k >=2), with no state considered plesiomorphic or apomorphic a priori. Along a
particular branch of the phylogeny, a character can change state at any instant in time,
with the probability of such an event being
equal for all such time intervals along the
branch. An instant is dened to be an innitesimal period of time, denoted *dt*, during
which there can be at most one substitution
(= change of state) event. Different instantaneous time periods are independent of one
another with respect to the probability of a
character state change, and the probability
of change is symmetrical (i.e., the instantaneous probability of changing from state i to state j
is the same as the instantaneous probability of changing from j to i). The length
of a branch under the Mk model is defined
to be the expected number of changes per
character across the branch, which is equal to :math:`(k - 1) \alpha t`, where
:math:`\alpha`
is the instantaneous rate of
any particular transition between states, and :math:`t`
is the amount of time represented by the
branch.

","multi-state models, evolutionary model, maximum likelihood, likelihood model"
Lewis2001,"My primary tool in the defense of the Mk
model is the fact that Tufey and Steel’s
(1997) parsimony model (the TS97 model),
when used within the framework of ML inference, has the property of always choosing
the same tree(s) as equally-weighted parsimony, even to the point of choosing multiple
trees if there are multiple most-parsimonious
solutions. That is, the likelihood under TS97
is a monotonically decreasing function of the
parsimony score, meaning that a likelihood
analysis using TS97 is identical to a parsimony analysis using equally-weighted par-
simony (the tree that minimizes the number
ofsteps also maximizes in L).Thus, the justication for using likelihood for morphological
data instead of parsimony hinges on whether
the differences between Mk and TS97 are
acceptable from both a biological and a statistical standpoint.","likelihood model, multi-state models, parsimony, likelihood,"
Lewis2001,"This
acquisition bias
never arises in the
use of likelihood for molecular phylogenetics because the linear nature of nucleic acids
and proteins allows easy circumscription of
a range of characters, including constant as
well as variable characters. Acquisition bias
is problematic because mean rates of evolution embodied in the branch length parameters will be overestimated if only variable
characters are present in the dataset. Because
branch lengths play an important role in determining the overall likelihoodfora particular tree topology, such overestimation, if not
corrected, would lead to bias in tree topology inferences. Fortunately, one can correct
for acquisition bias, and the remainder of this
section is devoted to an explanation of how
this is accomplished for the Mk model.","acquisition bias, morphological characters, multi-state models, likelihood model"
Lewis2001,"Characters can be divided into (1) parsimony-informative characters, which can potentially have different parsimony character
lengths on different trees; (2) autapomorphic
characters, which are variable but have the
same length on all trees; and (3) constant
characters, which have only one state. Because autapomorphic characters are considered uninformative by many systematists using parsimony, these too are often left out of
data sets used in phylogenetic analyses (for
an exception, see Funk and Wagner, 1995).
One of the reasons likelihood methods resist
long-branch attraction problems is that they
can accept an explanation of similarity based
on convergent or parallel evolution, whereas
parsimony allows only historical explanations of similarity among the terminal taxa.","autapomorphie, parsimony, parsimony-informative characters, morphological characters, likelihood model"

methods may choose to keep separate two
lineages having very long branches because
the evidence for convergence/parallelism is
(in this case) stronger than the evidence for
shared history (Felsenstein, 1978). If branch
lengths are incorrectly estimated (say, consistently overestimated), likelihood methods
would be biased in their choice of tree topology. Thus, it is important to in some way correct for the systematic omission of constant
characters. Autapomorphic and highly variable characters do not present the same problem as constant characters, being identiable
and at least enumerable.","long-branch attraction, likelihood model, multi-state models, morphological characters, acquisition bias"

Employing a simple mathematical model of cultural transmission in which individuals may copy each others traits, it can be shown that cultural evolution favors individuals who are weakly influenced by others and able to influence others. The model suggests that the cultural evolution of rules of cultural transmission tends to create populations that evolve rapidly toward conservatism. Bias in cultural transmission may result purely from cultural dynamics. Freedom from genetic influence is not freedom to take any direction.","cultural evolution, selection, cultural selection"

Darwin proposed that phenotypic variants represented the substrate for natural selection. This means that natural populations of living organisms are steadily exposed to the selective pressure exerted by the encountered living conditions. Variants that can deal better with their environment than others are thereby favoured and will overgrow less favoured variants in the longer term. This suggested that related phenotypic variants and related species of living organisms have common descent. In order to illustrate this situation, Chares Darwin has drawn in his notebooks symbolic evolutionary trees. This testifies of the idea that phenotypically related organisms and perhaps all living organisms represent a large evolutionary system of interrelatedness and historical interdependence.","selection, evolution, driving forces of evolution, evolutionary mechanisms"

Winther2008,"Darwin's 19th century evolutionary theory of descent with modification through natural selection opened up a multidimensional and integrative conceptual space for biology. We explore three dimensions of this space: explanatory pattern, levels of selection, and degree of difference among units of the same type. Each dimension is defined by a respective pair of poles: law and narrative explanation, organismic and hierarchical selection, and variational and essentialist thinking. As a consequence of conceptual debates in the 20th century biological sciences, the poles of each pair came to be seen as mutually exclusive opposites. A significant amount of 21st century research focuses on systems (e.g., genomic, cellular, organismic, and ecological/global). Systemic Darwinism is emerging in this context. It follows a “compositional paradigm” according to which complex systems and their hierarchical networks of parts are the focus of biological investigation. Through the investigation of systems, Systemic Darwinism promises to reintegrate each dimension of Darwin's original logical space. Moreover, this ideally and potentially unified theory of biological ontology coordinates and integrates a plurality of mathematical biological theories (e.g., self-organization/structure, cladistics/history, and evolutionary genetics/function). Integrative Systemic Darwinism requires communal articulation from a plurality of perspectives. Although it is more general than these, it draws on previous advances in Systems Theory, Systems Biology, and Hierarchy Theory. Systemic Darwinism would greatly further bioengineering research and would provide a significantly deeper and more critical understanding of biological reality.

Ferguson1990,"One of the most powerful tools in the armamentarium of linguists engaged in
the study of diachronic phonology is the often implicit notion that some changes
are phonetically more likely than others. Thus if a linguist finds a systematic
correspondence between [g] and [d  ] in two related language varieties, it will
be reasonable to assume that the stop is the older variant and the affricate the
younger one until strong counter evidence is found. The linguist makes such an
assumption because experience with many languages has shown that the change
of [g] to [d  ] is fairly common and tends to occur under certain well-documented
conditions whereas the reverse change is unusual and problematic. This line of
argumentation has been employed, either explicitly or implicitly, since the earliest
days of modern historical linguistics.

Because of the importance of this methodological tool, one might expect that
general treatises and introductory textbooks on historical linguistics would devote
considerable space to a presentation of the relative probabilities of various possible
sound changes, as well as explanatory factors accounting for them. Also, because
of the centrality of alternations and processes to the field of phonological theory,
one might expect that general treatises and introductory textbooks in phonology
would devote considerable space to this topic. Unfortunately, authors of books
on historical linguistics or phonological theory have a great deal of other ground

Zipf1935,"Frequency counts of phonemes, morphemes, and words in samples of written discourse in diverse languages are presented in support of the generalization that the more complex any speech element, the less frequently does it occur. Thus, the greater the frequency of occurrence of words, the less tends to be their average length, and the smaller also is the number of different words. The relation between frequency and number of different words is said to be expressed by the formula ab2 = k, in which a represents the number of different words of a given frequency and b the frequency. The relationship between the magnitude of speech elements and their frequency is attributed to the operation of a ""law"" of linguistic change: that as the frequency of phonemes or of linguistic forms increases, their magnitude decreases. There is thus a tendency to ""maintain an equilibrium"" between length and frequency, and this tendency rests upon an ""underlying law of economy."" Human beings strive to maintain an ""emotional equilibrium"" between variety and repetitiveness of environmental factors and behavior. A speaker's discourse must represent a compromise between variety and repetitiveness adapted to the hearer's ""tolerable limits of change in maintaining emotional equilibrium.""

The changes were found to be similar to historical change; reductions occurred in both signs and non-linguistic pantomime and for both signers and non-signers, implying the work of natural phonetic processes. In the second experiment, similar reductions were exhibited in signs when they underwent register shift, from citation form to conversational form.

Here I attempt to place Darwin's trees in historical context. By the mid-Eighteenth century the Great Chain of Being was increasingly seen to be an inadequate description of order in nature, and by about 1780 it had been largely abandoned without a satisfactory alternative having been agreed upon. In 1750 Donati described aquatic and terrestrial organisms as forming a network, and a few years later Buffon depicted a network of genealogical relationships among breeds of dogs. In 1764 Bonnet asked whether the Chain might actually branch at certain points, and in 1766 Pallas proposed that the gradations among organisms resemble a tree with a compound trunk, perhaps not unlike the tree of animal life later depicted by Eichwald. Other trees were presented by Augier in 1801 and by Lamarck in 1809 and 1815, the latter two assuming a transmutation of species over time. Elaborate networks of affinities among plants and among animals were depicted in the late Eighteenth and very early Nineteenth centuries. In the two decades immediately prior to 1837, so-called affinities and/or analogies among organisms were represented by diverse geometric figures. Series of plant and animal fossils in successive geological strata were represented as trees in a popular textbook from 1840, while in 1858 Bronn presented a system of animals, as evidenced by the fossil record, in a form of a tree. Darwin's 1859 tree and its subsequent elaborations by Haeckel came to be accepted in many but not all areas of biological sciences, while network diagrams were used in others. Beginning in the early 1960s trees were inferred from protein and nucleic acid sequences, but networks were re-introduced in the mid-1990s to represent lateral genetic transfer, increasingly regarded as a fundamental mode of evolution at least for bacteria and archaea.

The basic idea is that, as the theoretical value of any individual test is preforce limited, the number of tests has to be fairly high to reach relibalbe conclusions.

Olson2015,"Some adaptationist explanations are regarded as maximally solid and others fanciful just-so stories. Just-so stories are explanations based on very little evidence. Lack of evidence leads to circular-sounding reasoning: “this trait was shaped by selection in unseen ancestral populations and this selection must have occurred because the trait is present.” Well-supported adaptationist explanations include evidence that is not only abundant but selected from comparative, populational, and optimality perspectives, the three adaptationist subdisciplines. Each subdiscipline obtains its broad relevance in evolutionary biology via assumptions that can only be tested with the methods of the other subdisciplines. However, even in the best-supported explanations, assumptions regarding variation, heritability, and fitness in unseen ancestral populations are always present. These assumptions are accepted given how well they would explain the data if they were true. This means that some degree of “circularity” is present in all evolutionary explanations. Evolutionary explanation corresponds not to a deductive structure, as biologists usually assert, but instead to ones such as abduction or Bayesianism. With these structures in mind, we show the way to a healthier view of “circularity” in evolutionary biology and why integration across the comparative, populational, and optimality approaches is necessary.","adaptationism, adaptation, just-so stories, abduction, Bayesianism, biology"

Gusfield1997,"
The unweighted Steiner tree problem on hypercubes has been shown to be NP-hard [165].
Usually, the NP-hardness of an unweighted problem immediately implies the NP-hardness
on the weighted version of the problem. After all, the unweighted case is simply the
weighted case with all the weights set to one. However, the case of the Steiner tree problem
on hypercubes is different, and the result in [165] does not imply the NP-hardness of the
weighted Steiner tree problem on hypercubes. We leave it to the reader to puzzle out why
this might be. The answer, along with a proof that the weighted version is in fact NP-hard,
is contained in [198].
 
Although the weighted Steiner tree problem on hypercubes is NP-hard, an efficient
algorithm to approximate it to within a factor of less than two does exist. This follows
because the weighted Steiner tree problem on any graph can be efficiently approximated
within an error bound of 11 /6 [62,484]. Prior to that result, it was known that the minimum
spanning tree can be used to obtain a Steiner tree whose total weight is less than twice
the weight of the optimal Steiner tree [284]. Specialized to the case of the hypercube, the
method in brief is the following: a. compute the distance d(i, j) in the hypercube between
each pair of input objects / and j in set X (in the case of binary characters, this is just
the Hamming distance); b. form a complete, undirected graph Kx with one node for each
object in X and one edge between each pair of nodes, and assign weight d(i, j) to each
edge (/, j) in Kx; c. compute a minimum spanning tree T of Kx (where each edge in
T corresponds to a path in the hypercube); d. re-expand each edge in T to its original
corresponding path in the hypercube; e. superimpose the paths found in step d to form
graph G', and then find any spanning tree of G'. The result is a Steiner tree of X with total
weight less than twice that of the optimal.
 
The above description is only for conceptual purposes, and in the case of binary character
data, this computation can be done without explicitly embedding the problem in an actual
hypercube. That is quite important for efficiency. The better approximations given in [62]
and [484] can also be adapted for the maximum-parsimony problem without needing the
hypercube explicitly. We leave that as an exercise for the reader.","minimum spanning tree, parsimony, maximum parsimony, approximation"
Swofford2009,"Methods for inferring evolutionary trees can be divided into two broad categories:
those that operate on a matrix of discrete characters that assigns one or more
attributes or character states to each taxon (i.e. sequence or gene-family member);
and those that operate on a matrix of pairwise distances between taxa, with each
distance representing an estimate of the amount of divergence between two taxa
since they last shared a common ancestor (see Chapter 1). The most commonly
employed discrete-character methods used in molecular phylogenetics are 
**parsimony and maximum likelihood** methods. For molecular data, the character-state
matrix is typically an aligned set of DNA or protein sequences, in which the states
are the nucleotides A, C, G, and T (i.e. DNA sequences) or symbols representing the
20 common amino acids (i.e. protein sequences); however, other forms of discrete
data such as restriction-site presence/absence and gene-order information also may
be used.","PAUP, software, maximum parsimony, parsimony"

Woolley2008,"**Background**: We present a series of simulation studies that explore the relative performance of several phylogenetic
network approaches (statistical parsimony, split decomposition, union of maximum parsimony trees, neighbor-net,
simulated history recombination upper bound, median-joining, reduced median joining and minimum spanning network)
compared to standard tree approaches, (neighbor-joining and maximum parsimony) in the presence and absence of
recombination.

**Principal Findings**: In the absence of recombination, all methods recovered the correct topology and branch lengths nearly
all of the time when the substitution rate was low, except for minimum spanning networks, which did considerably worse.
At a higher substitution rate, maximum parsimony and union of maximum parsimony trees were the most accurate. With
recombination, the ability to infer the correct topology was halved for all methods and no method could accurately
estimate branch lengths.

**Conclusions**: Our results highlight the need for more accurate phylogenetic network methods and the importance of
detecting and accounting for recombination in phylogenetic studies. Furthermore, we provide useful information for
choosing a network algorithm and a framework in which to evaluate improvements to existing methods and novel
algorithms developed in the future.","network, phylogenetic network, networks, phylogenetic reconstruction, evaluation"
Forster2004,"Compositional heterogeneity among lineages can compromise phylogenetic analyses, because models in common
use assume compositionally homogeneous data. Models that can accommodate compositional heterogeneity with few extra
parameters are described here, and used in two examples where the true tree is known with confidence. It is shown
using likelihood ratio tests that adequate modeling of compositional heterogeneity can be achieved with few composition
parameters, that the data may not need to be modelled with separate composition parameters for each branch in the tree.
Tree searching and placement of composition vectors on the tree are done in a Bayesian framework using Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Assessment of fit of the model to the data is made in both maximum likelihood (ML) and
Bayesian frameworks. In an ML framework, overall model fit is assessed using the Goldman-Cox test, and the fit of the
composition implied by a (possibly heterogeneous) model to the composition of the data is assessed using a novel tree-
and model-based composition fit test. In a Bayesian framework, overall model fit and composition fit are assessed using
posterior predictive simulation. It is shown that when composition is not accommodated, then the model does not fit, and
incorrect trees are found; but when composition is accommodated, the model then fits, and the known correct phylogenies
are obtained.","compositional heterogeneity, data modeling, evolutionary model, phylogenetic reconstruction"

The trees are assumed to be rooted, with labelled tips but unlabelled root and unlabelled interior nodes. The method allows multifurcations as well as bifurcations.

There are 282,137,824 different trees having 10 tip species, and over 8.87 × 1023 different trees having 20 tip species. The method is extended to count trees some of whose interior nodes may be labelled. The principal uses of these numbers will be to double-check algorithms and notation systems, and to frighten taxonomists. ","phylogenetic tree, enumeration, combinatorics"

It also allows the testing of hypotheses about the constancy of evolutionary rates by likelihood ratio tests, and gives rough indication of the error of the estimate of the tree.","pruning algorithm, maximum likelihood, phylogenetic reconstruction, phylogenetic tree"
Felsenstein1973,"The general maximum likelihood approach to the statistical estimation of phylogenies is outlined, for data in which there are a number of discrete states for each character. The details of the maximum likelihood method will depend on the details of the probabilistic model of evolution assumed. There are a very large number of possible models of evolution. For a few of the simpler models, the calculation of the likelihood of an evolutionary tree is outlined. For these models, the maximum likelihood tree will be the same as the “most parsimonious” (or minimum-steps) tree if the probability of change during the evolution of the group is assumed a priori to be very small. However, most sets of data require too many assumed state changes per character to be compatible with this assumption. Farris (1973) has argued that maximum likelihood and parsimony methods are identical under a much less restrictive set of assumptions. It is argued that the present methods are preferable to his, and a counterexample to his argument is presented. An algorithm which enables rapid calculation of the likelihood of a phylogeny is described. ","pruning algorithm, phylogenetic tree, phylogenetic reconstruction, maximum likelihood"
Dotti2015,"Some knowledge of historical linguistics is expected of students of linguistics. This area presents a big challenge to most students of linguistics
because of either a lack of sufficient practice or a lack of a solid foundation in phonology and phonetics. In order to alleviate this problem, a
teaching tool was developed to assist in the practice of phonological and orthographical evolution since Indo-European until Present Day English.
Previous tools were aimed mostly at comparison, such as LingPy (@List2012) or Iberochange (Eastlack, 1977) and many are not functional today,
such as PHONO (Hartman, 2003). Previous approaches geared specifically at teaching this subject were not found. The goal is not only to help in
the acquisition of knowledge in historical linguistics, but also to foster scientific thought and to serve as a first approach towards scientific
linguistic research. With this in mind, the tool can be used in two different ways: teachers can preset the rules that they want students to practice,
or students can be instructed to deduce and create their own rules, and then simulate the evolution. The rules are defined in terms of patterns, such
as whether changes took place in all vowels or only long vowels or in a student-defined group of characters/phonemes, in what period the change
occurred, whether shifts were involved, whether there were exceptions, the phonetic/orthographic context in which the rule applies, etc. The tool
is currently being improved towards dialect identification, and it can interact with large corpora of English dialectal writing. The program also
makes use of statistical techniques to identify and suggest the most prominent features of English dialects, if provided with a sufficient number of
texts corresponding to that dialect.","LingPy, historical linguistics, computer-aided approaches"
Vos2003,"The existence of multiple likelihood maxima necessitates algorithms that explore a large part of the tree space.
However, because of computational constraints, stepwise addition-based tree-searching methods do not allow for this
exploration in reasonable time. Here, I present an algorithm that increases the speed at which the likelihood landscape
can be explored. The iterative algorithm combines the computational speed of distance-based tree construction methods to
arrive at approximations of the global optimum with the accuracy of optimality criterion based branch-swapping methods
to improve on the result of the starting tree. The algorithm moves between local optima by iteratively perturbing the tree
landscape through a process of reweighting randomly drawn samples of the underlying sequence data set. Tests on simulated
and real data sets demonstrated that the optimal solution obtained using stepwise addition-based heuristic searches was
found faster using the algorithm presented here. Tests on a previously published data set that established the presence
of tree islands under maximum likelihood demonstrated that the algorithm identifies the same tree islands in a shorter
amount of time than that needed using stepwise addition. The algorithm can be readily applied using standard software for
phylogenetic inference.","maximum likelihood, heuristics, methods"
Sagart2015,"This paper shows that the putative ‘East Formosan’ subgroup proposed in Blust (1999) on the basis
of a sound change allegedly turning a voiced palatalized velar stop into an alveolar nasal, pays no
attention to the geographical principle of conservation by the periphery, and to the need for
phonetically natural sound changes in historical interpretations. It argues that the phoneme known
as *j was a palatal nasal rather than a voiced palatalized velar stop, and proposes for it the new label
*n y . With support from the history of the Chinese palatal nasal, it argues that *n y evolved to a sound
combining nasality and friction, and that denasalisation of that sound occurred for lack of a
prenasalized series in which it could be integrated. The paper also shows, based on an earlier
proposal by Dahl, that the putative phoneme known as PAN *ñ, which competes with *n y for the
palatal nasal slot in the PAN consonant system, arose no earlier than PMP, with an independent
parallel development in the Formosan language Kanakanabu, when the outcome of the merger of
PAN *niV and *NiV became palatalized. It concludes that reconstructing PAN by validating
Dempwolff’s PMP is a counter-productive strategy and advocates reconstructing PAN directly on
Formosan evidence.","conservation by periphery, Austronesian, phylogeny, subgrouping"

two or more parts of the region but those parts are separated from one another by an
area in which a different, or opposing, feature occurs. Such a pattern indicates a late
stage in the displacement of a formerly widespread linguistic feature by an innova-
tion. In earlier times, the feature which now occurs in isolated areas was also found
in the in-between areas. Its status is now that of a relic feature, and the in-between
areas show the progress of the innovation.","conservation by periphery, dialectology, dialect geography, conservation,"

an error transforms itself into a winning argument !): because the likelihood of a bizarre sound
change taking place convergently in separate regions is low, the change will be said to have
occurred only once. A subgroup will be posited. A migration transporting the putative change’s
output to the other relic areas will be proposed. The proposed subgroup will of course not be
supported by any other innovations: but the bizarre character of the sound change said to define it
will be felt to provide sufficient evidence of its existence.","conservation by periphery, shared innovation, phylogenetic reconstruction, subgrouping"

Clemente2009,"**Background:** Parsimony methods are widely used in molecular evolution to estimate the most
plausible phylogeny for a set of characters. Sankoff parsimony determines the minimum number of
changes required in a given phylogeny when a cost is associated to transitions between character
states. Although optimizations exist to reduce the computations in the number of taxa, the original
algorithm takes time O(n 2 ) in the number of states, making it impractical for large values of n.

**Results:** In this study we introduce an optimization of Sankoff parsimony for the reconstruction
of ancestral states when ultrametric or additive cost matrices are used. We analyzed its
performance for randomly generated matrices, Jukes-Cantor and Kimura's two-parameter models
of DNA evolution, and in the reconstruction of elongation factor-1a and ancestral metabolic states
of a group of eukaryotes, showing that in all cases the execution time is significantly less than with
the original implementation.

**Conclusion:** The algorithms here presented provide a fast computation of Sankoff parsimony for
a given phylogeny. Problems where the number of states is large, such as reconstruction of
ancestral metabolism, are particularly adequate for this optimization. Since we are reducing the
computations required to calculate the parsimony cost of a single tree, our method can be
combined with optimizations in the number of taxa that aim at finding the most parsimonious tree.","parsimony, maximum parsimony, Sankoff parsimony, ancestral states, ancestral state reconstruction, optimization"

Blench2015a,"Historical linguistics inevitably contains many uncertainties due to gaps in the data, many of which are
contingent and will never be filled. In particular, the interpretation of the results depends on data from other
disciplines, although the links cannot be established according to any standard methodological criteria. But
the conclusion should not be drawn that this excludes a science-like fashion of proceeding. This should
involve;

* a) Careful compilation of complete datasets, using the best-transcribed material
* b) Identification of cognates through application of plausible phonological laws
* c) Identification of borrowing similarly, although with the additional of cultural/sociological insights 
   where appropriate
* d) Comparison with archaeological data where available, including specialised disciplines such as
   palaeoclimatology, archaeobotany etc.
* e) Comparison with historical anthropology as well as established generalisations in the field

Modern methods may allow time to be saved in data compilation, but there are no shortcuts on the analysis
side. Proposals for explanation of the datasets must be based on linguistic plausibility, but also match known
chronology and other corroboratory datasets. There is a school of historical linguistics which asserts that the
second part of this is unnecessary, that reconstructions are abstract forms that explain linguistic data. That if
we reconstruct ‘iron’ to a time and place when iron was unknown, an unexplained semantic shift has
occurred. Assuming this view is rejected then palaeosociolinguistics must meet criteria for both linguistic
and chronological plausibility. But what is being advanced is a model and to that extent it cannot meet the
classic test of falsifiability, it can only be made to seem less plausible by new analysis. Similarly, as a model
it can be applied in other parts of the world which seem at first sight similar, and if plausibility continues to
be maintained, a nascent generalisation occurs. But historical specificity cannot be ironed out; the
conjunction of the Roman limes and Berber livestock nomads and traders can only occur once. Working out
the narrative and convincing the scientific community should be challenge enough.","language levelling, computer-based approaches, critics, phylogenetic reconstruction, subgrouping"

We consider first the hierarchy of spoken language [2]: phoneme, morpheme, word, sentence,
utterance, discourse; or of written language: letter, syllable, word, sentence, paragraph, section,
chapter, book. These lists are straightforward up to and including the ""sentence,"" beyond which
they are somewhat arbitrary. The items, “utterance,"" ""paragraph,"" etc., are meant only to
illustrate more complex units and to suggest that linguistic hierarchies consist typically of a small
number of levels. This is characteristic of the organizational and/or operational structure of many
""concrete"" [3] systems; more ""abstract"" hierarchies, e.g. those which specify gradations of some
attribute, often consist of a greater number of elements. For example, the system of cosmological
entities, ordered by gravitational forces, ranges from aggregates of galaxies to planetary satellites,
meteors, etc., but the hierarchy of the structure of matter extends through additional levels down
to elementary particles and the like. Similarly, the organizational or ""line"" structure of command
in the military has fewer levels than might be suggested by existing gradations of rank.

Concrete systems are typically limited to a small number of
levels, say five to ten, after which the hierarchy often becomes consolidated in a stable and
coherent whole (which may become a base unit for still higher levels). We shall refer to the range
between base and terminal levels as a ""period."" For example, a library consists of two periods:
letter to book and book to library. The hierarchy of structures from atom to cell is, in our opinion,
also such an interval, the intermediary levels of which include small molecules, polymers,
macromolecular aggregates, and the like. We could continue on to tissues, organs, organ systems,
organisms, populations, etc., but suggest that the intervals from atom to cell and cell to organism
represent natural divisions. In general, there may be some uncertainty about which level should
begin and/or end a period, but the range of uncertainty is usually not great, and the principle of
this distinction, the idea of periods, is not purely subjective. For example, it would be
inappropriate to start the cellular hierarchy at the level of protons and neutrons or quarks, because
the domain of influence of the cell as a system does not penetrate down to these levels. Or we
might extend the biological hierarchy to include tissues, organs, and so on up to the level of the
individual organism, but at this point, biological structure most typically passes into social
organization, as in families, populations, and communities.

The biological hierarchy we shall actually discuss is the following: atom (or atomic ion);
chemical group (or small molecule or molecular ion); amino acid; (monomeric) protein;
(multimeric) enzyme; multienzyme complex; organelle (or membrane system); cell. That is, we
trace out only one ""path"" (of many) in the set of structures between single atoms and whole cells,
focusing mainly on proteins, the principal dynamic agents in the cell, and especially on those
entities of the protein hierarchy most general in function [4]. Thus, for example, above the level
of polypeptide chain or monomeric protein, we choose the ""spherical"" multimer rather than the
helical polymer, as the latter typically has a more specialized function. Much of the discussion,
which follows, will pertain also to the nucleic acids and to some deeper and more general
properties of the cellular period.","biological parallels, analogy, biology, linguistics, hierarchies, hierarchical order"

tree length or total number of character changes) is as important as the different tree
search strategies. Some techniques include short-cuts that have not been proven to
be exact, and an incremental character optimization approach by which the speedup
gains depends on data sets and is hardly analyzed in theory. This paper describes an

Grand2013,"The cladistic literature does not always specify the kind of multistate character treatment that is applied for an
analysis.  Characters  can  be  treated  either  as  unordered  transformation  series  or  as  rooted  [three-item  analysis
(3ia)] or unrooted state trees (ordered characters). We aimed to measure the impact of these character treatments
on phylogenetic inference. Discrete characters can be represented either as rows or columns in matrices (e.g. for
parsimony) or as hierarchies for 3ia. In the present study, we use simulated and empirical examples to assess the
relative  merits  of  each  method  considering  both  the  character  treatment  and  representation.  We  measure  two

Slowinski1993,"Multistate morphological characters have generally been treated as either ""unordered"" or ""ordered"" in phylogenetic analyses using parsimony Because ordering relations do not apply to the states of characters treated under these methods, I prefer ""maximally connected"" character to ""unordered"" character and ""minimally connected"" character to ""ordered"" character. This paper formally defines the two character types, compares their properties, and considers the consequences of the two methods for both resolution and congruence. The results demonstrate that minimally connected characters increase resolution relative to maximally connected characters. Minimally connected characters do not, however, necessarily increase congruence among data sets. Because both methods produce nonrandom congruence among data sets, both character types constitute valid phylogenetic methods. A mixed-parsimony approach is advocated, wherein multistate characters are treated as minimally connected whenever reasonable but treated as maximally connected otherwise.","ordered character states, maximum parsimony, multi-state models"
Xu2012,"For more than a century scholars have proposed laws of semantic change that characterize how words change in meaning
over time. Two such laws are the law of differentiation, which
proposes that near-synonyms tend to differentiate in meaning
over time, and the law of parallel change, which proposes that
related words tend to undergo parallel changes in meaning. Researchers have identified a handful of changes that are consis-
tent with each proposed law, but there are no systematic evaluations that assess the validity and generality of these compet-
ing laws. Here we evaluate these laws by using a large corpus
to assess how thousands of related words changed in meaning

Murawaki2015,"Phylogenetic models, originally developed to demonstrate evolutionary biology, have been applied to a wide range of cultural data including natural language lexicons, manuscripts, folktales, material cultures, and religions. A fundamental question regarding the application of phylogenetic inference is whether trees are an appropriate approximation of cultural evolutionary history. Their validity in cultural applications has been scrutinized, particularly with respect to the lexicons of dialects in contact. Phylogenetic models organize evolutionary data into a series of branching events through time. However, branching events are typically not included in dialectological studies to interpret the distributions of lexical terms. Instead, dialectologists have offered spatial interpretations to represent lexical data. For example, new lexical items that emerge in a politico-cultural center are likely to spread to peripheries, but not vice versa. To explore the question of the tree model’s validity, we present a simple simulation model in which dialects form a spatial network and share lexical items through contact rather than through common ancestors. We input several network topologies to the model to generate synthetic data. We then analyze the synthesized data using conventional phylogenetic techniques. We found that a group of dialects can be considered tree-like even if it has not evolved in a temporally tree-like manner but has a temporally invariant, spatially tree-like structure. In addition, the simulation experiments appear to reproduce unnatural results observed in reconstructed trees for real data. These results motivate further investigation into the spatial structure of the evolutionary history of dialect lexicons as well as other cultural characteristics.","network, phylogenetic network, phylogenetic reconstruction, simulation studies, lexical change, dialect change"

Kolaczkowski2004,"All inferences in comparative biology depend on accurate estimates of evolutionary relationships. Recent phylogenetic analyses have turned away from maximum parsimony towards the probabilistic techniques of maximum likelihood and bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (BMCMC). These probabilistic techniques represent a parametric approach to statistical phylogenetics, because their criterion for evaluating a topology—the probability of the data, given the tree—is calculated with reference to an explicit evolutionary model from which the data are assumed to be identically distributed. Maximum parsimony can be considered nonparametric, because trees are evaluated on the basis of a general metric—the minimum number of character state changes required to generate the data on a given tree—without assuming a specific distribution1. The shift to parametric methods was spurred, in large part, by studies showing that although both approaches perform well most of the time2, maximum parsimony is strongly biased towards recovering an incorrect tree under certain combinations of branch lengths, whereas maximum likelihood is not3, 4, 5, 6. All these evaluations simulated sequences by a largely homogeneous evolutionary process in which data are identically distributed. There is ample evidence, however, that real-world gene sequences evolve heterogeneously and are not identically distributed7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. Here we show that maximum likelihood and BMCMC can become strongly biased and statistically inconsistent when the rates at which sequence sites evolve change non-identically over time. Maximum parsimony performs substantially better than current parametric methods over a wide range of conditions tested, including moderate heterogeneity and phylogenetic problems not normally considered difficult.","maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, evaluation, performance, phylogenetic reconstruction"
Rindal2010,"The use of model-based methods to infer a phylogenetic tree from a given data set is frequently motivated by the truism that under certain circumstances the parsimony approach (MP) may produce incorrect topologies, while explicit model-based approaches are believed to avoid this problem. In the realm of empirical data from actual taxa, it is not known (or knowable) how commonly MP, maximum-likelihood or Bayesian inference are inaccurate. To test the perceived need for “sophisticated” model-based approaches, we assessed the degree of congruence between empirical phylogenetic hypotheses generated by alternative methods applied to DNA sequence data in a sample of 1000 recently published articles. Of 504 articles that employed multiple methods, only two exhibited strongly supported incongruence among alternative methods. This result suggests that the MP approach does not produce deviant hypotheses of relationship due to convergent evolution in long branches. Our finding therefore indicates that the use of multiple analytical methods is largely superfluous. We encourage the use of analytical approaches unencumbered by ad hoc assumptions that sap the explanatory power of the evidence.","maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, evaluation, performance, phylogenetic reconstruction"

pronunciations, or externally, from words common to different dialects or from
cognatic relations among related dialect words. Once this distinction is made, research

According to the author, the notion of general systems theory first stemmed from the pre-Socratic philosophers, and evolved throughout the ages through different philosophic entities until it was eventually formally structured in the early 1900s. The theory has three main aspects. The first is called “systems science,” or the scientific exploration and theory of systems in various sciences. The second is called “systems technology,” or the problems arising in modern technology and society. The third aspect is called “systems philosophy” and refers to the reorientation of thought and world view. ","complex systems, systems theory, general systems theory"

Milo2002,"Complex networks are studied across many fields of science. To uncover their structural design principles, we defined “network motifs,” patterns of interconnections occurring in complex networks at numbers that are significantly higher than those in randomized networks. We found such motifs in networks from biochemistry, neurobiology, ecology, and engineering. The motifs shared by ecological food webs were distinct from the motifs shared by the genetic networks of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae or from those found in the World Wide Web. Similar motifs were found in networks that perform information processing, even though they describe elements as different as biomolecules within a cell and synaptic connections between neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans. Motifs may thus define universal classes of networks. This approach may uncover the basic building blocks of most networks. ","complex network, complex systems, network motifs"
Milo2002,"In information-processing networks, the motifs may have specific functions as elementary computational circuits (11). More generally, they may be interpreted as structures that arise because of the special constraints under which the network has evolved (27).

Morrison2015b,"Sequence alignment is just as much a part of phylogenetics as is tree building, although it is often viewed solely as a necessary tool to construct trees. However, alignment for the purpose of phylogenetic inference is primarily about homology, as it is the procedure that expresses homology relationships among the characters, rather than the historical relationships of the taxa. Molecular homology is rather vaguely defined and understood, despite its importance in the molecular age. Indeed, homology has rarely been evaluated with respect to nucleotide sequence alignments, in spite of the fact that nucleotides are the only data that directly represent genotype. All other molecular data represent phenotype, just as do morphology and anatomy. Thus, efforts to improve sequence alignment for phylogenetic purposes should involve a more refined use of the homology concept at a molecular level. To this end, we present examples of molecular-data levels at which homology might be considered, and arrange them in a hierarchy. The concept that we propose has many levels, which link directly to the developmental and morphological components of homology. Of note, there is no simple relationship between gene homology and nucleotide homology. We also propose terminology with which to better describe and discuss molecular homology at these levels. Our over-arching conceptual framework is then used to shed light on the multitude of automated procedures that have been created for multiple-sequence alignment. Sequence alignment needs to be based on aligning homologous nucleotides, without necessary reference to homology at any other level of the hierarchy. In particular, inference of nucleotide homology involves deriving a plausible scenario for molecular change among the set of sequences. Our clarifications should allow the development of a procedure that specifically addresses homology, which is required when performing alignment for phylogenetic purposes, but which does not yet exist.","sequence alignment, multiple sequence alignment, homology"
Lukes2011,"Complex cellular machines and processes are commonly believed to be products of selection, and it is typically understood to be the job of evolutionary biologists to show how selective advantage can account for each step in their origin and subsequent growth in complexity. Here, we describe how complex machines might instead evolve in the absence of positive selection through a process of ""presuppression,"" first termed constructive neutral evolution (CNE) more than a decade ago. If an autonomously functioning cellular component acquires mutations that make it dependent for function on another, pre-existing component or process, and if there are multiple ways in which such dependence may arise, then dependence inevitably will arise and reversal to independence is unlikely. Thus, CNE is a unidirectional evolutionary ratchet leading to complexity, if complexity is equated with the number of components or steps necessary to carry out a cellular process. CNE can explain ""functions"" that seem to make little sense in terms of cellular economy, like RNA editing or splicing, but it may also contribute to the complexity of machines with clear benefit to the cell, like the ribosome, and to organismal complexity overall. We suggest that CNE-based evolutionary scenarios are in these and other cases less forced than the selectionist or adaptationist narratives that are generally told.","constructive neutral evolution, ratchet-like process, complexity, "
Lakkaraju2008,"Over their evolutionary history, languages most likely increased in complexity from simple sig-
nals to protolanguages to complex syntactic structures. This paper investigates processes for
increasing linguistic complexity while maintaining communicability across a population. We
assume that higher linguistic communicability (more accurate information exchange) increases
participants’ effectiveness in coordination-based tasks. Interaction, needed for learning others’
languages and for converging to communicability, bears a cost. There is a threshold of inter-
action (learning) effort beyond which (the coordination payoff of) linguistic convergence either
doesn’t pay or is pragmatically impossible. Our central findings, established mainly through
simulation, are: 1) There is an effort-dependent “frontier of tractability” for agreement on a lan-
guage that balances linguistic complexity against linguistic diversity in a population. To remain
below some specific bound on collective convergence effort,
either a) languages must be simpler, or b) their initial average communicability must be higher. To stay below such a pragmatic
effort limit, even agents who have the ultimate capability for complex languages must not invent them from the start or they won’t be able to communicate;
they must start simple and grow complexity in a staged process. 2) Such a staged approach to increasing complexity, in which agents initially converge on simple languages and then use these to “scaffold” greater complexity, can outperform initially-complex languages in terms of overall effort to convergence. This
performance gain improves with more complex final languages.

Bisang2010,"The present paper shows that constructions are the driving force of grammaticalization in Chinese. It will be argued that this is due to two typological properties: the relative freedom with which a lexical item can be assigned to different grammatical functions (precategoriality in Late Archaic Chinese) and the ease with which one and the same surface structure can be subject to different syntactic analyses (Bisang 2009 on “hidden complexity”). The constructions that are relevant for grammaticalization in Chinese consist of slots that are associated with certain grammatical categories. Processes of reanalysis take place within these slots – a given lexical item is assigned the function associated with the syntactic slot in which it occurs. Such a construction-based account excludes continuity because the occurrence in a particular slot always leads to a discrete interpretation that is determined by the function associated with that slot. Continuity is only possible if two or more constructions are combined into a larger structure or if a new construction emerges. The former case will be illustrated by verbs in adpositional functions (coverbs), the latter by the resultative construction as it emerged in the 1st centuries AD. Finally, the constructional approach will also show that Aarts’s (2004, 2007) distinction between subsective and intersective gradience cannot be maintained.","grammaticalization, Chinese, scaffolding"
Bisang2010,"The basic notion that underlies this framework is Langacker's scaffolding metaphor, in which ""component structures are seen as scaffolding [pb] erected for the construction of a complex expression"" (@Langacker1987:461).
In Croft's own words, ""what appears to be the coding of syntactic relations is in fact scaffolding to help the hearer to identify which element of the construction symbolizes which component in the semantic structure of teh construction (@Croft2001:238).","scaffolding, grammaticalization, Chinese"
Bisang2010,"Crofts (@<Croft>2001:238) idea that the syntactic structure of a construction is a ""scaffolding"" for identifying the semantic components of a construction also serves as a link to the concept of coerciion in terms of Michaelis (@<Michaelis>2004). In her account, the syntactic structure provides the pattern that has the power to coerce a lexical item into a particular function. Transferred to the situation in Late Archaic Chinese, this means that a lexical item occurring in a certain slot of a given construction is ""coerced"" into a particular semantic interpretation associated with that slot. The notion of coercion is no doubt adequate in the sense that a certain syntactic slot leads to a particular interpretation of a lexical item and thus excludes other potential interpretations. If it is used in a more strict sense that implies that a lexical item acquires a new function which is not foreseen in its lexicon, coercien is problematic in some instances. In the case of precategoriality, the occurrence of a lexical item in a certain slot only highlights or specifies a particular function that is inderspecified in the lexicon -- the lexical item is not forced into a new function. This is different with processes of grammaticalization in which a lexical item gets a new function as in the case of  verbs that are reanalysed as prepositions [...]. For the understanding of grammaticalization in Chinese, both concepts are important. The more general mechanism of scaffolding is important in spite of hidden tcomplexity and the high syntactic flexibility of lexical items. The more specific mechanism of coercion is necessary for understanding processes by which a lexical item is reanalysed in terms of a grammatical function it did not mark before, a process to which lexical items seemed to have been more open in Late Archaic Chinese than in languages of the English type.","scaffolding, grammaticalization, coercion, Chinese"

Darwin1859,"I am well aware that this doctrine of natural selection, exemplified in the above imaginary instances, is open to the same objections which were at first urged against Sir Charles Lyell's noble views on 'the modern changes of the earth, as illustrative of geology;' but we now very seldom hear the action, for instance, of the coast-waves, called a trifling and insignificant cause, when applied to the excavation of gigantic valleys or to the formation of the longest lines of inland cliffs. Natural selection can act only by the preservation and accumulation of infinitesimally small inherited modifications, each profitable to the preserved being; and as modern geology has almost banished such views as the excavation of a great valley by a single diluvial wave, so will natural selection, if it be a true principle, banish the belief of the continued creation of new organic beings, or of any great and sudden modification in their structure.

Maddison2006,"It is now well known that incomplete lineage sorting can cause serious difficulties for phylogenetic inference, but little attention has been paid to methods that attempt to overcome these difficulties by explicitly considering the processes that produce them. Here we explore approaches to phylogenetic inference designed to consider retention and sorting of ancestral polymorphism. We examine how the reconstructability of a species (or population) phylogeny is affected by (a) the number of loci used to estimate the phylogeny and (b) the number of individuals sampled per species. Even in difficult cases with considerable incomplete lineage sorting (times between divergences less than 1 Ne generations), we found the reconstructed species trees matched the “true” species trees in at least three out of five partitions, as long as a reasonable number of individuals per species were sampled. We also studied the tradeoff between sampling more loci versus more individuals. Although increasing the number of loci gives more accurate trees for a given sampling effort with deeper species trees (e.g., total depth of 10 Ne generations), sampling more individuals often gives better results than sampling more loci with shallower species trees (e.g., depth = 1 Ne). Taken together, these results demonstrate that gene sequences retain enough signal to achieve an accurate estimate of phylogeny despite widespread incomplete lineage sorting. Continued improvement in our methods to reconstruct phylogeny near the species level will require a shift to a compound model that considers not only nucleotide or character state substitutions, but also the population genetics processes of lineage sorting.","incomplete lineage sorting, phylogenetic reconstruction,"

Axelsen2014,"Global linguistic diversity (LD) displays highly heterogeneous distribution patterns. Though the origin of the latter is not yet fully understood, remarkable parallelisms with biodiversity distribution suggest that environmental variables should play an essential role in their emergence. In an effort to construct a broad framework to explain world LD and to systematize the available data, we have investigated the significance of 14 variables: landscape roughness, altitude, river density, distance to lakes, seasonal maximum, average and minimum temperature, precipitation and vegetation, and population density. Landscape roughness and river density are the only two variables that universally affect LD. Overall, the considered set accounts for up to 80% of African LD, a figure that decreases for the joint Asia, Australia and the Pacific (69%), Europe (56%) and the Americas (53%). Differences among those regions can be traced down to a few variables that permit an interpretation of their current states of LD. Our processed datasets can be applied to the analysis of correlations in other similar heterogeneous patterns with a broad spatial distribution, the clearest example being biological diversity. The statistical method we have used can be understood as a tool for cross-comparison among geographical regions, including the prediction of spatial diversity in alternative scenarios or in changing environments.","linguistic diversity, linguistic complexity, mountains, diversification"

Wichmann2009,"Previous empirical studies of population size and language change have produced equivocal results. We therefore address the question with a new set of lexical data from nearly one-half of the world's languages. We first show that relative population sizes of modern languages can be extrapolated to ancestral languages, albeit with diminishing accuracy, up to several thousand years into the past. We then test for an effect of population against the null hypothesis that the ultrametric inequality is satisfied by lexical distances among triples of related languages. The test shows mainly negligible effects of population, the exception being an apparently faster rate of change in the larger of two closely related variants. A possible explanation for the exception may be the influence on emerging standard (or cross-regional) variants from speakers who shift from different dialects to the standard. Our results strongly indicate that the sizes of speaker populations do not in and of themselves determine rates of language change. Comparison of this empirical finding with previously published computer simulations suggests that the most plausible model for language change is one in which changes propagate on a local level in a type of network in which the individuals have different degrees of connectivity.","population size, language change, rate of change"

Incongruence can occur for artefactual reasons, when we fail to recover the correct gene trees, or for biological reasons, when true gene trees are actually distinct from each other, and from the species tree. Horizontal gene transfers (HGTs) between genomes are an important process of bacterial evolution resulting in a substantial amount of phylogenetic conflicts between gene trees. We argue that the (bacterial) species tree is still a meaningful scientific concept even in the case of HGTs, and that reconstructing it is still a valid goal. We tentatively assess the amount of phylogenetic incongruence caused by HGTs in bacteria by comparing bacterial datasets to a metazoan dataset in which transfers are presumably very scarce or absent. We review existing phylogenomic methods and their ability to return to the user, both the vertical (speciation/extinction history) and horizontal (gene transfers) phylogenetic signals.","incomplete lineage sorting, phylogenetic incongruence, biology, "

In the case of gene duplication and subsequent loss, gene trees can differ from species trees, thus frequent gene duplication poses a challenge for reconstruction of species relationships. Here I address the case of multi-gene sets of putative orthologs that include some unrecognized paralogs due to ancestral gene duplication, and ask how outgroups should best be chosen to reduce the degree of non-species tree (NST) signal. Consideration of expected internal branch lengths supports several conclusions: (i) when a single outgroup is used, the degree of NST signal arising from gene duplication is either independent of outgroup choice, or is minimized by use of a maximally closely related post-duplication (MCRPD) outgroup; (ii) when two outgroups are used, NST signal is minimized by using one MCRPD outgroup, while the position of the second outgroup is of lesser importance; and (iii) when two outgroups are used, the ability to detect gene trees that are inconsistent with known aspects of the species tree is maximized by use of one MCRPD, and is either independent of the position of the second outgroup, or is maximized for a more distantly related second outgroup. Overall, these results generalize the utility of closely-related outgroups for phylogenetic analysis.","gene duplication, paralogy"

Laubichler2007,"Francois Jacob's article 'Evolution and Tinkering' published in Science in 1977 is still the locus classicus for the concept of tinkering in biology. It first introduced the notion of tinkering to a wide audience of scientists. Jacob drew on a variety of different sources ranging from molecular biology to evolutionary biology and cultural anthropology. The notion of tinkering, or more accurately, the concept of bricolage, are conceptual abstractions that allow for the theoretical analysis of a wide range of phenomena that are united by a shared underlying process--tinkering, or the opportunistic rearrangement and recombination of existing elements. This paper looks at Jacob's analysis as itself an example of conceptual tinkering. It traces the history of some of its elements and sketches how it has become part of an inclusive discourse of theoretical biology and evolutionary developmental biology that emerged over the last 30 years. I will argue that the theoretical power of Jacob's analysis lies in the fact that he captured a widespread phenomenon. His conceptual analysis is thus an example of an interdisciplinary synthesis that is based on a shared process rather than a shared object.","tinkering, evolution, biological parallels"

Thirty-six percent of replications had statistically significant results; 47% of original effect sizes were in the 95% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.

DeGroot1956,"Adrianus Dingeman de Groot (1914–2006) was one of the most influential Dutch psychologists. He became
famous for his work “Thought and Choice in Chess”, but his main contribution was methodological — De Groot
co-founded the Department of Psychological Methods at the University of Amsterdam (together with R. F. van
Naerssen), founded one of the leading testing and assessment companies (CITO), and wrote the monograph
“Methodology” that centers on the empirical-scientific cycle: observation–induction–deduction–testing–
evaluation. Here we translate one of De Groot's early articles, published in 1956 in the Dutch journal Nederlands
Tijdschrift voor de Psychologie en Haar Grensgebieden. This article is more topical now than it was almost 60 years
ago. De Groot stresses the difference between exploratory and confirmatory (“hypothesis testing”) research and
argues that statistical inference is only sensible for the latter: “One ‘is allowed’ to apply statistical tests in
exploratory research, just as long as one realizes that they do not have evidential impact”. De Groot may have
also been one of the first psychologists to argue explicitly for preregistration of experiments and the associated
plan of statistical analysis. The appendix provides annotations that connect De Groot's arguments to the
current-day debate on transparency and reproducibility in psychological science.","significance, reproducibility, science, "
Jaeger2015,"Computational phylogenetics is in the process of revolutionizing historical linguistics. Recent applications have shed new light on controversial issues, such as the location and time depth of language families and the dynamics of their spread. So far, these approaches have been limited to single-language families because they rely on a large body of expert cognacy judgments or grammatical classifications, which is currently unavailable for most language families. The present study pursues a different approach. Starting from raw phonetic transcription of core vocabulary items from very diverse languages, it applies weighted string alignment to track both phonetic and lexical change. Applied to a collection of ∼1,000 Eurasian languages and dialects, this method, combined with phylogenetic inference, leads to a classification in excellent agreement with established findings of historical linguistics. Furthermore, it provides strong statistical support for several putative macrofamilies contested in current historical linguistics. In particular, there is a solid signal for the Nostratic/Eurasiatic macrofamily. ","mass comparison, deep genetic relations, phylogenetic reconstruction, ASJP"

Murphy1999,"Protein design experiments have shown that the use of specific subsets of amino acids can produce foldable proteins. This prompts the question of whether there is a minimal amino acid alphabet which could be used to fold all proteins. In this work we make an analogy between sequence patterns which produce foldable sequences and those which make it possible to detect structural homologs by aligning sequences, and use it to suggest the possible size of such a reduced alphabet. We estimate that reduced alphabets containing 10–12 letters can be used to design foldable sequences for a large number of protein families. This estimate is based on the observation that there is little loss of the information necessary to pick out structural homologs in a clustered protein sequence database when a suitable reduction of the amino acid alphabet from 20 to 10 letters is made, but that this information is rapidly degraded when further reductions in the alphabet are made.

Universal Grammar, but this misses the generalization that the grammatical constraints
normally correspond to constraints on language use. As in biology, observed adaptive
patterns in language can be explained through diachronic evolutionary processes, as the
unintended cumulative outcome of numerous individual intentional actions. The theory of
diachronic adaptation also provides a solution to the teleology problem, which has often

typical generative theory of language. As such, there is no theory-internal reason

essentially no explanation of how and why our linguistic computations and representations
evolved. We show that, to date, (1) studies of nonhuman animals provide virtually no

capacity; (2) the fossil and archaeological evidence does not inform our understanding of
the computations and representations of our earliest ancestors, leaving details of origins

impoverished that there is little hope of connecting genes to linguistic processes any time
soon; (4) all modeling attempts have made unfounded assumptions, and have provided
no empirical tests, thus leaving any insights into language’s origins unverifiable. Based
on the current state of evidence, we submit that the most fundamental questions about
the origins and evolution of our linguistic capacity remain as mysterious as ever, with
considerable uncertainty about the discovery of either relevant or conclusive evidence

However, languages change over time; therefore, they are also historically modified objects. Considering that
natural organisms are historically modified natural objects, I look for inspiration in evolutionary theory to
better specify what kinds of objects languages are and how they change and diversify. I conclude that every
language is a ‘unique evolutionary history’ within a restricted space of design. This conclusion means that
although the structure of languages reveals aspects of formal elegance and aspects of functional efficiency,
there are no arguments to state that these aspects are manifested more or less intensely in some languages
than in others. Then their formal and functional aspects are part of what is common to all languages, while
variable parts of language are a reflection of the essentially historical nature of the lexical interface between
the components of our language organs.","language evolution, language model, biological parallels"

Wheeler2015,"**Background**

Many problems in comparative biology are, or are thought to be, best expressed as phylogenetic
“networks” as opposed to trees. In trees, vertices may have only a single parent (ancestor), while networks allow for
multiple parent vertices. There are two main interpretive types of networks, “softwired” and “hardwired.” The
parsimony cost of hardwired networks is based on all changes over all edges, hence must be greater than or equal to
the best tree cost contained (“displayed”) by the network. This is in contrast to softwired, where each character follows
the lowest parsimony cost tree displayed by the network, resulting in costs which are less than or equal to the best
display tree. Neither situation is ideal since hard-wired networks are not generally biologically attractive (since
individual heritable characters can have more than one parent) and softwired networks can be trivially optimized
(containing the best tree for each character). Furthermore, given the alternate cost scenarios of trees and these two
flavors of networks, hypothesis testing among these explanatory scenarios is impossible.

**Results**

A network cost adjustment (penalty) is proposed to allow phylogenetic trees and soft-wired phylogenetic
networks to compete equally on a parsimony optimality basis. This cost is demonstrated for several real and simulated
datasets. In each case, the favored graph representation (tree or network) matched expectation or simulation scenario.

**Conclusions**

The softwired network cost regime proposed here presents a quantitative criterion for an
optimality-based search procedure where trees and networks can participate in hypothesis testing simultaneously.

Vogt2010,"The present article discusses the need for standardization in morphology in order to increase comparability and communicability

data but are not data themselves. By comparing morphological traits and DNA sequence data we reveal fundamental conceptual
shortcomings of the former that result from their high average degree of individuality. We argue that the delimitation of
morphological units, of datum units, and of evidence units must be distinguished, each of which involves its own specific problems.
We conclude that morphology suffers from the linguistic problem of morphology that results from the lack of (i) a commonly
accepted standardized morphological terminology, (ii) a commonly accepted standardized and formalized method of description,
and (iii) a rationale for the delimitation of morphological traits. Although this is not problematic for standardizing metadata, it
hinders standardizing morphological data. We provide the foundation for a solution to the linguistic problem of morphology, which
is based on a morphological structure concept. We argue that this structure concept can be represented with knowledge
representation languages such as the resource description framework (RDF) and that it can be applied for morphological
descriptions. We conclude with a discussion of how online databases can improve morphological data documentation and how a
controlled and formalized morphological vocabulary, i.e. a morphological RDF ontology, if it is based on a structure concept, can
provide a possible solution to the linguistic problem of morphology.","standardization, biology, morphology, "

Haak2015,"We generated genome-wide data from 69 Europeans who lived between 8,000–3,000 years ago by enriching ancient DNA libraries for a target set of almost 400,000 polymorphisms. Enrichment of these positions decreases the sequencing required for genome-wide ancient DNA analysis by a median of around 250-fold, allowing us to study an order of magnitude more individuals than previous studies and to obtain new insights about the past. We show that the populations of Western and Far Eastern Europe followed opposite trajectories between 8,000–5,000 years ago. At the beginning of the Neolithic period in Europe, ~8,000–7,000 years ago, closely related groups of early farmers appeared in Germany, Hungary and Spain, different from indigenous hunter-gatherers, whereas Russia was inhabited by a distinctive population of hunter-gatherers with high affinity to a ~24,000-year-old Siberian6. By ~6,000–5,000 years ago, farmers throughout much of Europe had more hunter-gatherer ancestry than their predecessors, but in Russia, the Yamnaya steppe herders of this time were descended not only from the preceding eastern European hunter-gatherers, but also from a population of Near Eastern ancestry. Western and Eastern Europe came into contact ~4,500 years ago, as the Late Neolithic Corded Ware people from Germany traced ~75% of their ancestry to the Yamnaya, documenting a massive migration into the heartland of Europe from its eastern periphery. This steppe ancestry persisted in all sampled central Europeans until at least ~3,000 years ago, and is ubiquitous in present-day Europeans. These results provide support for a steppe origin9 of at least some of the Indo-European languages of Europe.","expansion, migration, Indo-European, Steppe Hypothesis"

Hansson2008,"Phonological systems show clear signs of being shaped by phonetics. Sound patterns are overwhelmingly phonetically ‘natural’, in that they reflect the influence of physical constraints on speech production and perception, and categorical phonological processes often mirror low-level gradient phonetic effects. The question of how best to explain and model the influence of phonetics on phonology has been approached in different ways, one of which situates the locus of explanation in the diachronic domain of language change, in particular sound change. On this view, recurrent sound patterns merely reflect recurrent sound changes with phonetic origins, typically in speech perception. Explicit models of sound change are reviewed and illustrated, in particular Ohala's listener-based model and Blevins’ Evolutionary Phonology framework, and the relevance of exemplar-based models of speech production and perception is also noted. Current issues of controversy regarding the adequacy of diachronic vs. synchronic explanations for the typology of sound patterns are surveyed.","sound change, sound patterns, evolutionary phonology"
Natale2000,"The immunology of human papillomavirus (HPV) infections has peculiar characteristics. The long latency for cervical cancer development after primary viral infection suggests mechanisms that may aid the virus in avoiding the host immunosurveillance and establishing persistent infections. In order to understand whether molecular mimicry phenomena might explain the ability of HPV to avoid a protective immune response by the host cell, sequence similarity between HPV16 E7 oncoprotein and human self-proteins was examined by computer-assisted analysis. Data were obtained showing that the HPV16 E7 protein has high and widespread similarity to several human proteins involved in a number of critical regulatory processes. In addition, multiple identical and different E7 peptide motifs are present in the same human protein. Thus, sharing of common motifs between viral oncoproteins and molecules of normal cells may be one cause underlying the scarce immunogenicity of HPV infections. The hypothesis is advanced that synthetic peptides harbouring viral motifs not and/or scarcely represented in the host's cellular proteins may represent a valuable immunotherapeutic approach for cervical cancer treatment.","computer-aided approaches, computer-assisted analysis"

Barrachina2008,"Current machine translation (MT) systems are still not perfect. In practice, the output
from these systems needs to be edited to correct errors. A way of increasing the productivity of
the whole translation process (MT plus human work) is to incorporate the human correction
activities within the translation process itself, thereby shifting the MT paradigm to that of
computer-assisted translation. This model entails an iterative process in which the human
translator activity is included in the loop: In each iteration, a prefix of the translation is validated
(accepted or amended) by the human and the system computes its best (or n-best) translation
suffix hypothesis to complete this prefix. A successful framework for MT is the so-called statis-

of MT systems to the interactive scenario affects mainly the search process, allowing a great
reuse of successful techniques and models. In this article, alignment templates, phrase-based

Rogozin2006,"The Dollo parsimony method is based on the assumption that a complex character that has been lost during evolution of a particular lineage cannot be regained. When applicable, this principle leads to a substantial simplification of evolutionary analysis and provides for unambiguous reconstruction of evolutionary scenarios, which may not be attainable with other methods. In this chapter, applications of Dollo parsimony are described for the quantitative analysis of the dynamics of genome evolution. Dollo parsimony is the method of choice for reconstructing evolution of the gene repertoire of eukaryotic organisms because although multiple, independent losses of a gene in different lineages are common, multiple gains of the same gene are improbable. This contrasts with the situation in prokaryotes where the widespread occurrence of horizontal gene transfer makes multiple gains possible, thereby invalidating the Dollo principle. The chapter applies Dollo parsimony to reconstruct the scenario of evolution for the genomes of crown-group eukaryotes by assigning the loss of genes and emergence of new genes to the branches of the phylogenetic tree, and delineate the minimal gene sets for various ancestral forms. A similar analysis, with rather unexpected results, was performed to infer gain versus loss of introns in conserved eukaryotic genes. The applicability of the Dollo principle for these and other problems in evolutionary genomics is discussed.","Dollo parsimony, Dollo model, parsimony, maximum parsimony"
Koehnlein2015," The production of a contour tone requires a longer duration than the production of a level tone. This paper demonstrates that this durational relationship becomes considerably more complex when tones are realized on bimoraic sonorant units that can support both level tones and contour tones. Evidence comes from diachronic processes in which pitch and duration interact. In languages where (intrinsic) durational differences between two groups of bimoraic units lead to tonal contrasts, the longer units commonly receive a contour tone, and the shorter ones a level tone; yet over time, the units with the fully developed contour tone tend to shorten, and those with the level tone tend to lengthen. Ultimately, this can even lead to durational reversals between the units in question. The discussion focuses primarily on Franconian tone accent dialects but also incorporates data from Estonian, Hup, Las Norias Piman and North Low Saxon.

Previous accounts of kin classification have often emphasized constraints that are specific to the domain of kinship and are not derived from general principles. Here, we propose an account that is founded on two domain-general principles: Good systems of categories are simple, and they enable informative communication. We show computationally that kin classification systems in the world’s languages achieve a near-optimal trade-off between these two competing principles. We also show that our account explains several specific constraints on kin classification proposed previously. Because the principles of simplicity and informativeness are also relevant to other semantic domains, the trade-off between them may provide a domain-general foundation for variation in category systems across languages.

Gilchrist2004,"Paracrine factors secreted by oocytes play a pivotal role in promoting early ovarian follicle growth and in defining a morphogenic gradient in antral follicles, yet the exact identities of these oocyte factors remain unknown. This study was conducted to determine the extent to which the mitogenic activity of mouse oocytes can be attributed to growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9). To do this, specific anti-human GDF9 monoclonal antibodies were generated. Based on epitope mapping and bioassays, a GDF9 neutralizing antibody, mAb-GDF9-53, was characterized with very low cross-reactivity with related transforming growth factor (TGF)beta superfamily members, including BMP15 (also called GDF9B). Pep-SPOT epitope mapping showed that mAb-GDF9-53 recognizes a short 4-aa sequence, and three-dimensional peptide modeling suggested that this binding motif lies at the C-terminal fingertip of mGDF9. As predicted by sequence alignments and modeling, the antibody detected recombinant GDF9, but not BMP15 in a Western blot and GDF9 protein in oocyte extract and oocyte-conditioned medium. In a mouse mural granulosa cell (MGC) bioassay, mAb-GDF9-53 completely abolished the mitogenic effects of GDF9, but had no effect on TGFbeta1 or activin A-stimulated MGC proliferation. An unrelated IgG at the same dose had no effect on GDF9 activity. This GDF9 neutralizing antibody was then tested in an established oocyte-secreted mitogen bioassay, where denuded oocytes cocultured with granulosa cells promote cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. The mAb-GDF9-53 dose dependently (0-160 microg/ml) decreased the mitogenic activity of oocytes but only by approximately 45% at the maximum dose of mAb. Just 5 microg/ml of mAb-GDF9-53 neutralized 90% of recombinant mGDF9 mitogenic activity, but only 15% of oocyte activity. Unlike mAb-GDF9-53, a TGFbeta pan-specific neutralizing antibody did not affect the mitogenic capacity of the oocyte, but completely neutralized TGF beta 1-induced DNA synthesis. This study has characterized a specific GDF9 neutralizing antibody. Our data provide the first direct evidence that the endogenous GDF9 protein is an important oocyte-secreted mitogen, but also show that GDF9 accounts for only part of total oocyte bioactivity.","alignment editor, GoCore, computer-aided approaches, computer-assisted analysis"
Donati2015,"**BACKGROUND**

Phylogenetic tree reconciliation is the approach of choice for investigating the coevolution of sets of organisms such as hosts and parasites. It consists in a mapping between the parasite tree and the host tree using event-based maximum parsimony. Given a cost model for the events, many optimal reconciliations are however possible. Any further biological interpretation of them must therefore take this into account, making the capacity to enumerate all optimal solutions a crucial point. Only two algorithms currently exist that attempt such enumeration; in one case not all possible solutions are produced while in the other not all cost vectors are currently handled. The objective of this paper is two-fold. The first is to fill this gap, and the second is to test whether the number of solutions generally observed can be an issue in terms of interpretation. 

**RESULTS**

We present a polynomial-delay algorithm for enumerating all optimal reconciliations. We show that in general many solutions exist. We give an example where, for two pairs of host-parasite trees having each less than 41 leaves, the number of solutions is 5120, even when only time-feasible ones are kept. To facilitate their interpretation, those solutions are also classified in terms of how many of each event they contain. The number of different classes of solutions may thus be notably smaller than the number of solutions, yet they may remain high enough, in particular for the cases where losses have cost 0. In fact, depending on the cost vector, both numbers of solutions and of classes thereof may increase considerably. To further deal with this problem, we introduce and analyse a restricted version where host switches are allowed to happen only between species that are within some fixed distance along the host tree. This restriction allows us to reduce the number of time-feasible solutions while preserving the same optimal cost, as well as to find time-feasible solutions with a cost close to the optimal in the cases where no time-feasible solution is found.

**Background**

Maximum parsimony is one of the most commonly used criteria for reconstructing phylogenetic trees. Recently, Nakhleh and co-workers extended this criterion to enable reconstruction of phylogenetic networks, and demonstrated its application to detecting reticulate evolutionary relationships. However, one of the major problems with this extension has been that it favors more complex evolutionary relationships over simpler ones, thus having the potential for overestimating the amount of reticulation in the data. An ad hoc solution to this problem that has been used entails inspecting the improvement in the parsimony length as more reticulation events are added to the model, and stopping when the improvement is below a certain threshold.

**Results**

In this paper, we address this problem in a more systematic way, by proposing a nonparametric bootstrap-based measure of support of inferred reticulation events, and using it to determine the number of those events, as well as their placements. A number of samples is generated from the given sequence alignment, and reticulation events are inferred based on each sample. Finally, the support of each reticulation event is quantified based on the inferences made over all samples.

**Conclusions**

We have implemented our method in the NEPAL software tool (available publicly at http://bioinfo.cs.rice.edu/ webcite), and studied its performance on both biological and simulated data sets. While our studies show very promising results, they also highlight issues that are inherently challenging when applying the maximum parsimony criterion to detect reticulate evolution.

It includes the majority languages of China and Myanmar, plus minority languages in China, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, and Northeast India. Three main factors have been involved in the formation of the present-day Sino-Tibetan language family: a shared genetic origin, divergent population movements (i.e. innovations appearing in the different groups after their split), and language contact (among themselves and with non-Sino-Tibetan languages). Population movements and language contact have in fact generally been two aspects of a single phenomenon. This paper looks at the history of the development of the Sinitic branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family from the point of view of population movements and language contact, to show the role language contact has had in the formation of the branch as we know it today. These factors have been an important part of the development of the branch from its origin in the central plains of what is now north China, in the valley of the Yellow River, some 6,500 years ago, right up to the present, and are still the main factors in language change today.","language contact, Sino-Tibetan, Chinese, Chinese dialects, "
Kressing2015,"The scope of this paper is to highlight models of reticulate evolution in a dual sense: (1) by stressing the importance of early models of horizontal/lateral transfer instead of models of unilinear vertical transfer in biology, linguistics, anthropology and related disciplines, and (2) by demonstrating that the acceptance of evolutionism as leitmotif in the nineteenth century was only possible by intense and repeated networks between scholars of different academic realms which lead to the assumption that the development of biological species and human cultures could be perceived as part of the same co-evolutionary process. Contrary to these widely popularized models of unilinear evolution, I would like to draw attention to alternative theories emphasizing the horizontal transfer of words, phenotypes/genotypes, and culture traits. Examples are the method of areal typology in linguistics, the theory of endosymbiosis in biology, and the anti-evolutionist attitude in Boasian anthropology, combined with an emphasis on the diffusion of culture traits. Further, it shall be pointed out that, even when—after the general dismissal of evolutionist ideas in the beginning of the twentieth century—the idea of co-evolutionary processes in the development of human populations and languages was again forwarded in the late twentieth century, this ‘modern synthesis’ of genetics, linguistics and archeology relied largely on interdisciplinary reticulations between sciences and humanities and serves as another example of reticulate evolution.","phylogenetic network, reticulate evolution, anthropological evolution, language history, language evolution, biological evolution, biological parallels"
Bradie2015,"Darwinian models of cultural change have been motivated, in part, by the desire to provide a framework for the unification of the biological and the human sciences. In this paper, drawing upon a distinction between the evolution of enabling mechanisms for the acquisition and dissemination of knowledge (EEM) and the evolution of epistemic theses as cultural products (EET), we propose a model of how culture emerges as a product of biological evolution on the basis of the concept of reaction norms. The goal of this model is to provide a means for conceptualizing how the biological and the cultural realms are connected, when they start to disconnect, and what the key transitions are. We then assess the viability of a Darwinian approach to cultural change. We conclude that the prospects of producing a Darwinian model of cultural change that unifies the human sciences in a way that mirrors the unification of the biological sciences in the light of Darwin’s theory are rather dim.","cultural evolution, Darwin, biological evolution, biological parallels"

inspired claim for language change made by Pagel et al. (2007). Th ey report that the more
Swadesh-list lexemes are used, the less likely they are to change across 87 Indo-European lan-
guages, and posit that frequency-of-use of a lexical item is a separate and general mechanism of
language change. We test a corollary of this conclusion, namely that current frequency-of-use
should predict the amount of change within individual languages through time. We devise a
scale of lexical change that recognizes sound change, analogical change and lexical replacement
and apply it to cognate pairs on the Swadesh list between Homeric and Modern Greek. Current
frequency-of-use only weakly predicts the amount of change within the history of Greek, but
amount of change does predict the number of forms across Indo-European. Given that current
frequency-of-use and past frequency-of-use may be only weakly correlated for many Swadesh-list
lexemes, and given previous research that shows that frequency-of-use can both hinder and facili-
tate lexical change, we conclude that it is premature to claim that a new mechanism of language
change has been discovered. However, we call for more in-depth comparative study of general
mechanisms of language change, including further tests of the frequency-of-use hypothesis.","lexical change, analogy, paradigm levelling"

six-point scale as seen in Table 1 . Th e cognate pairs were then checked and
corrected by a senior researcher in Greek historical linguistics and, subsequently, two other researchers in the fi eld were asked to apply the scale to
the Swadesh list. The inter-scorer correlations are quite robust (all above 0.7),
but, on the basis of the scorers’ reports that the scale may be too fi ne-grained,
we decided to construct a three point scale, that distinguishes changes on

situating it in the developing field of historical sociolinguistics. The landmark
paper of Weinreich et al. (1968), which paid increased attention to extralinguistic factors in the explanation of language variation and change, served as an
important basis for the gradual development and expansion of historical sociolinguistics as a separate (sub)field of inquiry, notably since the influential work
of Romaine (1982). This article traces the development of the field of historical
sociolinguistics and considers some of its basic principles and assumptions,
including the uniformitarian principle and the so-called bad data problem.
Also, an overview is provided of some of the directions recent research has
taken, both in terms of the different types of data used, and in terms of
important approaches, themes and topics that are relevant to many studies
within the field. The article concludes with considerations of the necessarily
multidisciplinary nature of historical sociolinguistics, and invites authors from
various research traditions to submit original research articles to the journal,

Auer2015,"The important role of Weinreich et al.’s (1968) seminal paper has already been
pointed out. Interested in a more profound understanding of language change, the
paper is centered around five central problems to be solved: (i) identifying the
(crosslinguistic) constraints on linguistic change; (ii) studying the transition of
features from one speaker to another; (iii) uncovering the embedding of changes,
both in the linguistic and in the social structure; (iv) taking into account speakers’
evaluations of linguistic forms; and (v) delving into the actuation of language
change, with causes for change originating from “stimuli and constraints both
from society and from the structure of the language” (@Weinreich<1968> et al. 1968: 186).","challenges, language change, historical linguistics, methodology, sociolinguistics"
Auer2015,"To answer these questions, historical sociolinguists can draw on insights and
principles from modern-day sociolinguistics, on the working assumption that the
fundamental principles and mechanisms of language variation and change are
valid across time. This uniformitarian principle finds its origin in the premise of
uniformitarianism in natural sciences such as geology and is described by Labov
(@Labov1972: 275) as the idea that “the forces operating to produce linguistic change today
are of the same kind and order of magnitude as those which operated five or ten
thousand years ago” (cf. also @Joseph2011 for further discussion). This principle [pb]
certainly holds true for basic assertions, such as “the fact that language must
always have been variable, that different social groups and genders had different
ways of speaking, and that people have always been aware of these differences”
(@Bergs2012: 96).","uniformitarianism, historical linguistics, language change"
Labov1972,"Current difficulties in achieving intersubjective agreement in linguistics
require attention to principles of methodology which consider sources of
error and ways to eliminate them. The methodological assumptions and
practices of various branches of linguistics are considered from the stand-
point of the types of data gathered: texts, elicitations, intuitions and observa-
tions. Observations of the vernacular provide the most systematic basis for
linguistic theory, but have been the most difficult kinds of data for linguists
to obtain; techniques for solving the problems encountered are outlined.
Intersubjective agreement is best reached by convergence of several kinds
of data with complementary sources of error.","methodology, historical linguistics, uniformitarianism"
Auer2015,"However, applying the idea of uniformitarianism beyond such
basic assumptions holds the danger of “ideational anachronism” (@Bergs2012),
whereby we transpose modern concepts such as social class, gender or prestige to
historical settings, the applicability and validity of which is largely constricted to
modern Western societies. To avoid the pitfalls of anachronism, it is the task of
historical sociolinguists to reconstruct a broad picture of the social context in which
the language varieties under investigation were used, drawing on the inductive
method to identify the social conditions of language variation and change, ensuring
empirical, social and historical validity (cf. @Nevalainen2006). In fact, this challenge
lies at the heart of the so-called historical paradox: we know that the past was
different, but what we do not know exactly is how different it was (@Labov1994: 11; cf.
@Nevalainen2010). For this reason, historical sociolinguistics needs to transcend the
mere application of modern-day sociolinguistic methods and questions to historical
settings: part of the endeavor lies exactly in finding out how different the past was,
and thus “every language period and every linguistic community must be investi-
gated independently and in its own right” (@Bergs2012: 96).","uniformitarianism, historical linguistics, methodology"
Auer2015,"The requirement to come by enough data is of course
aggravated by the bad data problem. As pointed out earlier, written sources –
especially from times when literacy was not common – have a strong bias
toward the educated classes, which excludes large parts of the population
from available textual records. This makes it very hard to get a complete picture
of the social distribution of any linguistic feature at a given time in the past.
Since education is connected to class and gender, the literacy bias entails a
social bias, which is why certain sectors of society, such as women or the lower
classes, have been under-represented in conventional language histories. One of
the core concerns of historical sociolinguistics, therefore, is the effort to over-
come the social bias connected to class, education and literacy inherent in
written sources that has afflicted language historiography.","bad data, sparse data, historical linguistics"
Bergs2012,"The Uniformitarian Principle (UP), sometimes also referred to as the Priniple of Uniformity, very simply claims that the processes which we observe in the present can help us to gain knowledge about processes in the past. The reasoning behind this is that we must assume that whatever happens today must also have been possible in the past; whatever is impossible today must have been impossible in the past. If we observe today that water (on earth...) boils at around 100 degrees Celsius, we can assume that it also did so at any given point in the past. This means that when we analyze a historical phenomenon we should first look at known causes in order to explain it, before we turn to unknown causes. [...] In the humanities, however, the Uniformitarian Principle must be taken with a pinch of salt since there is no clear and simple correlate to the laws of nature. The aim of this chapter is to evaluate critically the usefulness of the Uniformitarian principle in historical linguistics in general and in historical sociolinguistics in particular. To this end, I wil first discuss the history of this principle in linguistics and of its traditional uses in historical linguistics. I will then proceed with a discussion of its usefulness in sociohistorical linguistics and the risks associated with it, in [pb] particular, the danger of anachronism.

Bergs2012,"Anachronism in the literal sense translates as 'against time' and usually means an error in chronology, typically placing  some state or event earlier in history than it can actually have occured. If you are shooting a movie about the Roman Empire you certainly do not want any of the actors to wear wrist watches on the set -- simply because these did not exist. And the Romans should [pb] not go to war with handguns -- gunpowder did not reach mainland Europe or even the Islamic world before about 1200. Similarly, potatoes probably did not figure in the diet of people in medieval Europe, because they come from south America and can only have been imported from there after 1492. If you want to claim that some Jon Doe in Worcestershire in 1275 had jacket potatoes for lunch, you may of course do that, but you need to show convincingly how those potatoes came to England before 1492.","anachronism, uniformitarianism"
Bergs2012,"In (historical) linguistics, the concept of anachronism has not been extensively discussed -- which is surprising, given that it is a key issue in history as a scientific discipline. Still, one particularly obvious anachronism may be commited in historical linguistics and is occasionally an issue in discussions: that is, positing or assuming language structures which are neither attested nor plausible at the releventa point in time (like the watch in the movie on the Roman empires). So, for example, Old English simply did not have *do*-periphrasis or a fully-fledged system of modal verbs, nor did it have voiced and/or voiceless labio-dental fricative phonemes. ","anachronism, uniformitarianism"
Bergs2012,"It seems very plausible to assume that speakers have always had individual social networks, based on ties to other members of their speech community. And it seems equally plausible to assume that these networks and ties -- despite different features on the network strength scales -- were basically characterized by very similar factors: the number of ties a given speaker has, and the quality of those ties (good friends, loose friends, socioeconomic dependency, etc.). This is certainly a way in which the uniformity principle makes a lot of sense, even though data problems can make the analysis of historical networks very difficult (see Bergs 2005: 45-42).

Now, it is very tempting to think that networks have also always operated in the same fashion: loose-knit networks facilitate change, tight-knit networks are norm-enforcing, central members are more conservative than bridges, and so on. This iddea, however, is problematic. ONce again, the whole concept of conservative versus innovative language use in relation to linguistic norms (such as a langauge standard) crucially depends on the existence of those overtly prescribed linguistic norms and the idea of a language standard as such.","social networks, anachronism, uniformitarianism, historical linguistics"
Langer2012,"Linguistic Purism is one of the most noticeable areas of historical sociolinguistics since it very publicly deals with what speakers think of (particular) language use. It thus touches on the ﬁeld of folk linguistics – as deﬁned by Niedzielski and Preston (2000) – which places great importance on the
 perception
 of language varie-ties, rather than just the sociological signiﬁcance of particular linguistic variables and variants. There is no agreement amongst academic linguists as to what counts as linguistic purism and what does not. The principal divisions lie, on the one hand, between those for whom an attempt to rid a language of
any
 undesirable elements constitutes purism and those who deﬁne it more narrowly as an attempt to rid a language only of
 foreign
 elements, and on the other, between those who see linguistic purism as a completely unacceptable academic activity and those who feel that purism is sometimes a subject worthy of study for academic lin-guists, such as with regard to the protection of regional or minority languages, or the process of standardizing and codifying a language.

As it stands, the study of purism is connected to several important aspects of historical linguistics, including the process of standardizing languages, the use of language as a building block in the creation of nations, and the stigmatiza-tion of linguistic varieties or cultures as undesirable, or even a threat to one ’ s identity. There are a number of publications on this subject, of which three in particular provide fairly recent and comprehensive overviews and case studies from different languages and historical periods: van der Sijs (1999) , Brincat, Boeder, and Stolz (2003) , and Langer and Davies (2005) .

Hoey2005,"Collocations -- recurrent combinations of words -- are [pb] both pervasive and subversive. Their pervasiveness is widely recognised in corpus linguistics; probably all lexical items have collocations (Sinclair 1991; Stubbs 1996). The notion is usually attributed to Firth ([1951]1957), and certainly his discussion of the concept underpins all that has followed on the subject. Interestingly, though, Doyle (2003) draws attention to the fact that the word *collocation* was being used in linguistic discourse prior to Firth; in this connection he draws attention to a citation from 1940 in the *Oxford English Dictionary * (1995).

Hoey2005,"The statistical definition of collocation is that it is 'the relationship a lexical item has with items that appear with greater than random probability in its (textual) context' (Hoey 1991a: 6-7). This definition, though better, confuses method with goal. It is true that to discover collocations one needs to examine the statistical distribution of words and that those that occur in each other's company more often than can be accounted for by the mechanisms of random distribution can be said to collocate. But the definition says nothing interesting [pb] about the phenomenon; it gives no cluse as to why collocation should exist in the first place.  ","collocations, language structure, lexicon"

Secondly, the languages in which counter-directional grammatical changes occur

be less hierarchical than in many modern IE languages. As an example of this,
we will consider the lexicalization of colour in antiquity. We will see that this

He reiterated this point a few years later in proposing that without duplicated genes the creation of metazoans, vertebrates, and mammals from unicellular organisms would have been impossible. Such big leaps in evolution, he argued, required the creation of new gene loci with previously nonexistent functions (98). Bold statements such as these, combined with his proposal that at least one whole-genome duplication event facilitated the evolution of vertebrates, have made Ohno an icon in the literature on genome evolution. However, discussion on the occurrence and consequences of gene and genome duplication events has a much longer, and often neglected, history. Here we review literature dealing with the occurence and consequences of gene duplication, begining in 1911.

Webber2004,"Richard @Owen<1843> (1804–1892) defined homology as “the same organ under every variety of form and function”. Owen conceived of homologous structures as those that, while differing in detail, were derived from the same body plan, or ‘archetype’. By contrast, analogous structures were those that performed similar functions but did not appear to be derived from the same archetype. After Darwin, homologous morphologies were reinterpreted as having derived by divergence from a common ancestral structure. Meanwhile, analogous morphologies were thought to have arisen by convergence, such as the independent invention of wings during bird and bat evolution. So now, homology describes descent from a common evolutionary origin: two genes are homologous if they derive from the same ancestral gene. Differentiating between homology and analogy is not mere pedantry: homology allows Darwinian evolutionary theory to be applied accurately across the biosciences. And, as Theodosius Dobzhansky (1900–1975) famously remarked, “Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution”.","homology, definition, history of science"
Webber2004,"Definitely not. Sequence similarity is a quantity that is agnostic of evolution. In contrast, homology is a property that describes evolutionary history. Just as with bird wings and bat wings, perceived similarities between sequences need not be due to a common evolutionary origin. Research papers sometimes wrongly quote values of ‘percent homology’. In these cases ‘percent identity’ is meant, as two genes either have a common ancestor or they do not. The only appropriate use of ‘percent homology’ is when separate portions of a gene have distinct evolutionary histories, for example as a result of a gene fusion event.","homology, sequence similarity"
Webber2004,"Using statistics you can estimate how likely it is that randomly composed sequences yield alignment scores that are at least as high as that obtained between the real sequences in question. For example, the BLAST program reports an Expect (or E) value for each alignment (with score x), which is the number of times sequences are expected, with scores ≥x, to crop up in a search just by chance. As E gets closer to zero, the more confident one should be in a prediction of homology. Many users cautiously consider only those alignments with E-values lower than 10−3 as substantiating evidence for homology.","sequence similarity, homology, definition"
Webber2004,"These are relationships between genes best visualized in a phylogenetic tree. Orthologs are genes resulting from the splitting of different lineages – speciation. Paralogous genes arise from duplications within the same genome. Lastly, genes that have been acquired via horizontal – or ‘lateral’ – transfer between different species are referred to as xenologues.

These relationships are clearly illustrated in Figure 1. However, lineage-specific gene deletion, pseudogenisation, duplication, conversion and rapid sequence divergence can all confuse phylogenetic tree reconstruction. For example, the loss of genes A2 and B1 in Figure 1 may cause duplication event DP1 to go undetected, and hence an erroneous assignment of paralogous genes A1 and B2 as orthologs. Gene conversion fuses sequences with contrasting heritages. It can result in a gene in one species being both orthologous and paralogous to a gene in another. Horizontal gene transfers can lead to incongruencies between gene-based and taxon-based trees which often assist the detection of xenology relationships.

Note that these relationships are defined with respect to evolution, and not function. Nevertheless, they are useful in predicting function as the more recently two genes shared a common ancestor, the more likely it is that they have retained similar functions. Moreover, orthologous genes that have been spared by natural selection from deletion or duplication over many millions of years are also likely to share overlapping functions.","orthology, paralogy, xenology, homology, definition"
Webber2004,"No: the same terms can be used for genomic regions encompassing several genes, and even single nucleotide sites. For example, large chromosomal segments that arose by an intra-genome duplication are paralogous genomic regions, which some call ‘paralogons’. Similarly, sequences that have persisted essentially intact in two species since their common ancestor may be termed orthologous genomic regions.","orthology, paralog, xenology, homology, "

Gontier2015,"Since the 1990s, results coming in from molecular phylogenetics necessitate us to recognize that Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) occurs massively across all three domains of life. Nonetheless, many of the mechanisms whereby genes can become transferred laterally have been known from the early twentieth century onward. The temporal discrepancy between the ﬁrst historical observations of the processes, and the rather recent general acceptance of the documented data, poses an interesting epis-temological conundrum: Why have incoming results on HGT been widely neglected by the general evolutionary community and what causes for a more favorable recep-tion today? Five reasons are given: (1) HGT was ﬁrst observed in the biomedical sci-ences and these sciences did not endorse an evolutionary epistemic stance because of the ontogeny/phylogeny divide adhered to by the founders of the Modern Synthesis. (2) Those who did entertain an evolutionary outlook associated research on HGT with a symbiotic epistemic framework. (3) That HGT occurs across all three domains of life was demonstrated by modern techniques developed in molecular biology, a ﬁeld that itself awaits full integration into the general evolutionary synthesis. (4) Molecular phylogenetic studies of prokaryote evolution were originally associated with exobiol-ogy and abiogenesis, and both ﬁelds developed outside the framework provided by the Modern Synthesis. (5) Because HGT brings forth a pattern of reticulation, it contrasts the standard idea that evolution occurs solely by natural selection that brings forth a vertical, bifurcating pattern in the “tree” of life. Divided into two parts, this chap-ter ﬁrst reviews current neo-Darwinian “tree of life” versus reticulate “web of life” polemics as they have been debated in high-proﬁle academic journals, and secondly, the historical context of discovery of the various means whereby genes are transferred laterally is sketched. Along the way, the reader is introduced to how HGT contradicts some of the basic tenets of the neo-Darwinian paradigm.","lateral gene transfer, history of science"

Kassian2015b,"In this paper we discuss the results of an automated compari-
son between two 50-item groups of the most generally stable
elements on the so-called Swadesh wordlist as reconstructed
for Proto-Indo-European and Proto-Uralic. Two forms are
counted as potentially related if their first two consonantal
units, transcribed in simplified consonantal class notation (a
rough variant of the Levenshtein distance method), match up
with each other. Next to all previous attempts at such a task
(Ringe 1998; Oswalt 1998; Kessler & Lehtonen 2006; Kessler
2007), our automated algorithm comes much closer to emulating the traditional procedure of cognate search as em-
ployed in historical linguistics. “Swadesh slots” for protolanguages are filled in strict accordance with such principles of
reconstruction as topology (taking into consideration the
structure of the genealogical tree), morphological transparency, typology of semantic shifts, and areal distribution of
particular items. Altogether we have counted 7 pairs where
Proto-Indo-European and Proto-Uralic share the same biconsonantal skeleton (the exact same pairs are regarded as
cognates in traditional hypotheses of Indo-Uralic relationship). To verify the probability of arriving at such a result by
chance we have applied the permutation test, which yielded a
positive result: the probability of 7 matched pairs is equal to
1.9% or 0.5%, depending on the constituency of the consonantal classes, which is lower than the standard 5% threshold
of statistical significance or even lower than the strong 1%
level. Standard methodology suggests that we reject the null
hypothesis (accidental resemblance) and offer a more plau-
sible explanation for the observed similarities. Since the
known typology of language contacts does not speak in favor
of explaining the observed Indo-Uralic matches as old lexical
borrowings, the optimal explanation is seen in the hypothesis
of an Indo-Uralic genetic relationship, with the 7 matching
pairs in question representing archaic retentions, left over
from the original Indo-Uralic protolanguage.

Fisler2013,"The aim of this study is to explore whether matrices and MP trees used to produce systematic categories of organisms could
be useful to produce categories of ideas in history of science. We study the history of the use of trees in systematics to
represent the diversity of life from 1766 to 1991. We apply to those ideas a method inspired from coding homologous parts
of organisms. We discretize conceptual parts of ideas, writings and drawings about trees contained in 41 main writings; we
detect shared parts among authors and code them into a 91-characters matrix and use a tree representation to show who
shares what with whom. In other words, we propose a hierarchical representation of the shared ideas about trees among
authors: this produces a ‘‘tree of trees.’’ Then, we categorize schools of tree-representations. Classical schools like ‘‘cladists’’
and ‘‘pheneticists’’ are recovered but others are not: ‘‘gradists’’ are separated into two blocks, one of them being called here
‘‘grade theoreticians.’’ We propose new interesting categories like the ‘‘buffonian school,’’ the ‘‘metaphoricians,’’ and those
using ‘‘strictly genealogical classifications.’’ We consider that networks are not useful to represent shared ideas at the
present step of the study. A cladogram is made for showing who is sharing what with whom, but also heterobathmy and
homoplasy of characters. The present cladogram is not modelling processes of transmission of ideas about trees, and here it

disyllable is now regarded as the preferred word-form in the Modern Chinese lexicon. Given the fact
that, as said in section 3, the syllable in Chinese largely coincides with the morpheme, and, therefore,
almost all disyllables are made up of two lexical morphemes, it is not surprising that Chinese has been
defined as a “language of compound words”, as quoted in the introduction. However, I insist that disyl-

each other; we shall now examine the mechanisms which led to this peculiar configuration of the Chi-

Arcodia2007,"In the literature about Chinese word formation, Mandarin has often been described as a ""language of compounded words"" (see Lin 2001, Dong 2004), with compounding as the main process in Chinese word formation. This paper proposes that the coinage of a great number of compounded words was caused by several factors: the morphology of the language, the near- absence of agglutinating or inflectional morphological markers (which can act as ""word boundaries""), and the stability of the phonological (and orthographical) shape of Chinese morphemes, together with the scarcity of grammatical morphemes compared to lexical ones. The paper then provides a functional motivation for the development of different kinds of compounds. From the structural point of view, this is reflected in zero-marking in phrases which designate an easily identifiable and frequent referent, and zero-marking for coordination in syntax. Finally, the paper proposes that there may be a correlation between the synthetic character of word formation in a language and the abundance of compounds in it, whereas in languages with a tendency to analyticity in word formation, such as Romance languages, compounding is expected to be a less prominent phenomenon. ","Chinese, compounding"
Arcodia2007,"According to the first (Cheng, 1992: 44, Packard, 2000: 265-266), in the transition from a primitive
society to a feudal one (between 1000 and 300 B.C.), there was a pragmatic need to create new words
for new referents: “the shift towards the use of disyllabic words occurred when free monosyllabic
words combined into new disyllabic words both through compounding (...) and through abbreviation of
longer phrases. The newly juxtaposed morphemes subsequently often lost their status as free words,
undergoing semantic shift or reduction due to the general effects of lexicalization (...)” (Packard, 2000:
365). According to the ‘phonological explanation’, which is indeed very common in the literature and
seem to enjoy a widespread consensus (see e.g. Wang, 1998, Lin, 2001, Shi, 2002), the simplification
of the phonology of the language caused the loss of many distinctions, and many syllables which were
once separated became homophonous: to avoid ambiguity, the size of the word was enlarged, by adding
an extra syllable.","disyllabification, Chinese, language history"

list of lexical items. However, it is particularly central to Word Grammar, in which

than a simple list because the elements among the parts are in a many-to-many
relation. There are lexemes which have more than one meaning (polysemy); there
are meanings which are shared by more than one lexeme (synonymy); and there
are lexemes which have more than one form (inherent variability).","language change, language model, network"

can vary. The first case can be simply resolved by coding only the variable part,
but the latter case is more problematic. In fact, the root and the affix/modifier
cannot be split into two characters, since they have a linked evolution within a
semantic slot. We thus coded each combination root/affix or modifier as a new
state. There are also cases of optional affixation, which we coded as distinct
states from the stable form. For instance, the meaning “head” is represented in
Nanchang (Gan) by the root 头 (tou2), state one, which can appear either systematically suffixed as in Zhangping (Min) 头壳 (ke4), state two, or optionally
suffixed as in Guangzhou (Yue) 头 [壳], state three. The duplication of a root

Here we explore the efficacy of Bayesian estimation of phylogeny, using the Mk model, under conditions that are commonly encountered in paleontological studies. Using simulated data, we describe the relative performances of parsimony and the Mk model under a range of realistic conditions that include common scenarios of missing data and rate heterogeneity.","Bayesian approaches, maximum parsimony, morphological data, "
Schwenk2001,"This paradox is at the heart of our ignorance of how phenotypes evolve and
it manifests a growing philosophical schism in the field. At one extreme we have
the traditional, atomistic approach as noted--organisms viewed as little more
than ""bags of characters,"" each character available for individual honing by
environmental selection to create adapted phenotypes (Rieppel, 1986).
Accordingly, the phenotype is held to be highly responsive to the exigencies of
an ever-changing environment, virtually protean through evolutionary time, with
diversity the inevitable outcome. Change, though inevitable, occurs
incrementally, character by character. Phenotypic stasis is seen as exceptional
and explicable only by reference to unusually persistent environmental
conditions (Simpson, 1953). In short, the organism can be understood as the sum
of its parts in relation to the environment.
 
Yet this view of the phenotype is transparently false. Characters are not
diffused through space, but are grouped and bounded within organisms where
they exist in ordered relations with one another to form tissues, organs, and
systems (Whyte, 1965). These character associations are further related
temporally through development and growth, and dynamically through
functional interaction. As historical entities, organisms transmit not only their
morphological features from one generation to the next, but their unique set of
organizational properties, as well--the patterns of interaction among their
characters. Thus, by virtue of being organismal attributes, characters must evince
associations with other characters. Organisms thus manifest complexly nested
webs of character interaction and integration, such that a phenotypic change in
one character will almost certainly have an impact on others.","functional units, character states, character concept, biological evolution, systemic processes"
Hoehna2014,"Recent years have seen a rapid expansion of the model space explored in statistical phylogenetics, emphasizing
the need for new approaches to statistical model representation and software development. Clear communication and
representation of the chosen model is crucial for: (i) reproducibility of an analysis, (ii) model development, and (iii)
software design. Moreover, a unified, clear and understandable framework for model representation lowers the barrier for
beginners and nonspecialists to grasp complex phylogenetic models, including their assumptions and parameter/variable
dependencies. Graphical modeling is a unifying framework that has gained in popularity in the statistical literature in
recent years. The core idea is to break complex models into conditionally independent distributions. The strength lies
in the comprehensibility, flexibility, and adaptability of this formalism, and the large body of computational work based
on it. Graphical models are well-suited to teach statistical models, to facilitate communication among phylogeneticists
and in the development of generic software for simulation and statistical inference. Here, we provide an introduction
to graphical models for phylogeneticists and extend the standard graphical model representation to the realm of
phylogenetics. We introduce a new graphical model component, tree plates, to capture the changing structure of the
subgraph corresponding to a phylogenetic tree. We describe a range of phylogenetic models using the graphical model
framework and introduce modules to simplify the representation of standard components in large and complex models.
Phylogenetic model graphs can be readily used in simulation, maximum likelihood inference, and Bayesian inference

In particular, our analyses exclude the root of the tree of life from the eukaryotes

exclude the root of the archaeal radiation from several major clades, consistent
with analyses using other rooting methods. Overall, our results demonstrate the

Williams2015,"Here, we consider
another approach to rooting phylogenetic trees: the use of
non-reversible or non-stationary substitution models, in
which the likelihood of the tree depends on the position of
the root. These models allow the tree to be rooted as an integral
part of the analysis, without the need for outgroups. Despite
the potential of these approaches for addressing questions in
deep phylogeny, there has been surprisingly little work on
the subject. 
@Barry<1987> & Hartigan [19] developed a non-reversible
and non-stationary substitution model that was implemented
by @Jayaswal<2005> et al. [20] and has been applied to the inference
of rooted trees [21 @Jayaswal2011b]; however, the large number of parameters
involved has limited the general applicability of the model.
Yang & Roberts [22] proposed a non-stationary model which
allowed a change in the composition vector at each speciation
event. They fitted their model to small-subunit ribosomal
RNA (rRNA) sequences from across the tree of life, and recov-
ered an eocyte tree in which the root was placed between
E. coli—the single bacterial representative—and the remaining
sequences. 
 
The NDCH model of @Foster<2004> [23] and the BP model
of Blanquart & Lartillot [24,25] are similar except a fixed, but
unknown, number of composition vectors apply to different
parts of the tree. While these models have the potential to
offer a more parsimonious description of the data, their
unknown dimension makes model-fitting computationally
difficult. Finally, @Huelsenbeck<2002> et al. [26] investigated the ability
of a non-reversible model to correctly identify the root position

when the data contained a high degree of non-reversibility.

We perform simulation analyses to examine the relative ability of these three criteria to correctly identify the root of the tree. The outgroup and molecular clock criteria were best able to identify the root of the tree, whereas the nonreversible model was able to identify the root only when the substitution process was highly nonreversible. We also examined the performance of the criteria for a tree of four species for which the topology and root position are well supported.

Foster2004,"Compositional heterogeneity among lineages can compromise phylogenetic analyses, because models in common use assume compositionally homogeneous data. Models that can accommodate compositional heterogeneity with few extra parameters are described here, and used in two examples where the true tree is known with confidence. It is shown using likelihood ratio tests that adequate modeling of compositional heterogeneity can be achieved with few composition parameters, that the data may not need to be modelled with separate composition parameters for each branch in the tree. Tree searching and placement of composition vectors on the tree are done in a Bayesian framework using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Assessment of fit of the model to the data is made in both maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian frameworks. In an ML framework, overall model fit is assessed using the Goldman-Cox test, and the fit of the composition implied by a (possibly heterogeneous) model to the composition of the data is assessed using a novel tree-and model-based composition fit test. In a Bayesian framework, overall model fit and composition fit are assessed using posterior predictive simulation. It is shown that when composition is not accommodated, then the model does not fit, and incorrect trees are found; but when composition is accommodated, the model then fits, and the known correct phylogenies are obtained.","irreversible markov processes, compositional heterogeneity, directionality, Bayesian approaches"

Jayaswal2011,"The general Markov model (GMM) of nucleotide substitution does not assume the evolutionary process to be stationary, reversible, or homogeneous. The GMM can be simplified by assuming the evolutionary process to be stationary. A stationary GMM is appropriate for analyses of phylogenetic data sets that are compositionally homogeneous; a data set is considered to be compositionally homogeneous if a statistical test does not detect significant differences in the marginal distributions of the sequences. Though the general time-reversible (GTR) model assumes stationarity, it also assumes reversibility and homogeneity. We propose two new stationary and nonhomogeneous models--one constrains the GMM to be reversible, whereas the other does not. The two models, coupled with the GTR model, comprise a set of nested models that can be used to test the assumptions of reversibility and homogeneity for stationary processes. The two models are extended to incorporate invariable sites and used to analyze a seven-taxon hominoid data set that displays compositional homogeneity. We show that within the class of stationary models, a nonhomogeneous model fits the hominoid data better than the GTR model. We note that if one considers a wider set of models that are not constrained to be stationary, then an even better fit can be obtained for the hominoid data. However, the methods for reducing model complexity from an extremely large set of nonstationary models are yet to be developed.","general markov process, directionality, irreversible markov processes, Bayesian approaches"

Klopfstein2015,"Directional evolution has played an important role in shaping the morphological, ecological, and molecular diversity of life. However, standard substitution models assume stationarity of the evolutionary process over the time scale examined, thus impeding the study of directionality. Here we explore a simple, nonstationary model of evolution for discrete data, which assumes that the state frequencies at the root differ from the equilibrium frequencies of the homogeneous evolutionary process along the rest of the tree (i.e., the process is nonstationary, nonreversible, but homogeneous). Within this framework, we develop a Bayesian approach for testing directional versus stationary evolution using a reversible-jump algorithm. Simulations show that when only data from extant taxa are available, the success in inferring directionality is strongly dependent on the evolutionary rate, the shape of the tree, the relative branch lengths, and the number of taxa. Given suitable evolutionary rates (0.1-0.5 expected substitutions between root and tips), accounting for directionality improves tree inference and often allows correct rooting of the tree without the use of an outgroup. As an empirical test, we apply our method to study directional evolution in hymenopteran morphology. We focus on three character systems: wing veins, muscles, and sclerites. We find strong support for a trend toward loss of wing veins and muscles, while stationarity cannot be ruled out for sclerites. Adding fossil and time information in a total-evidence dating approach, we show that accounting for directionality results in more precise estimates not only of the ancestral state at the root of the tree, but also of the divergence times. Our model relaxes the assumption of stationarity and reversibility by adding a minimum of additional parameters, and is thus well suited to studying the nature of the evolutionary process in data sets of limited size, such as morphology and ecology.

However, this assumption is violated in many datasets which show substantial heterogeneity in sequence composition across taxa. We propose a model which allows compositional heterogeneity across branches, and formulate the model in a Bayesian framework. Specifically, the root and each branch of the tree is associated with its own composition vector whilst a global matrix of exchangeability parameters applies everywhere on the tree. We encourage borrowing of strength between branches by developing two possible priors for the composition vectors: one in which information can be exchanged equally amongst all branches of the tree and another in which more information is exchanged between neighbouring branches than between distant branches. We also propose a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for posterior inference which uses data augmentation of substitutional histories to yield a simple complete data likelihood function that factorises over branches and allows Gibbs updates for most parameters. Standard phylogenetic models are not informative about the root position. Therefore a significant advantage of the proposed model is that it allows inference about rooted trees. The position of the root is fundamental to the biological interpretation of trees, both for polarising trait evolution and for establishing the order of divergence among lineages. Furthermore, unlike some other related models from the literature, inference in the model we propose can be carried out through a simple MCMC scheme which does not require problematic dimension-changing moves. We investigate the performance of the model and priors in analyses of two alignments for which there is strong biological opinion about the tree topology and root position.","heterogeneity, Bayesian approaches, probability models"
Rivas2008,"A fundamental task in sequence analysis is to calculate the probability of a multiple alignment given a phylogenetic tree relating the sequences and an evolutionary model describing how sequences change over time.

Starting from a continuous Markov process, we construct a non-reversible generative (birth–death) evolutionary model for insertions and deletions. The model assumes that insertion and deletion events occur one residue at a time. We apply this model to phylogenetic tree inference by extending the program dnaml in phylip. Using standard benchmarking methods on simulated data and a new “concordance test” benchmark on real ribosomal RNA alignments, we show that the extended program dnamlε improves accuracy relative to the usual approach of ignoring gaps, while retaining the computational efficiency of the Felsenstein peeling algorithm.","phylgenetic reconstruction, ancestral state reconstruction, insertion, deletion, irreversible markov processes"

Wiens2001,"Many aspects of morphological phylogenetics are controversial in the theoretical systematics literature and yet are often poorly explained and justified in empirical studies. In this paper, I argue that most morphological characters describe variation that is fundamentally quantitative, regardless of whether they are coded qualitatively or quantitatively by systematists. Given this view, three fundamental problems in morphological character analysis (definition, delimitation, and ordering of character states) may have a common solution: coding morphological characters as continuous quantitative traits. A new parsimony method (step-matrix gap-weighting, a modification of Thiele's approach) is proposed that allows quantitative traits to be analyzed as continuous variables. The problem of scaling or weighting quantitative characters relative to qualitative characters (and to each other) is reviewed, and three possible solutions are described. The new coding method is applied to data from hoplocercid lizards, and the results show the sensitivity of phylogenetic conclusions to different scaling methods. Although some authors reject the use of continuous, overlapping, quantitative characters in phylogenetic analysis, quantitative data from hoplocercid lizards that are coded using the new approach contain significant phylogenetic structure and exhibit levels of homoplasy similar to those seen in data that are coded qualitatively.

Wiens2004,"We live in the age of comparative genomics, and it may seem that there is not much point in reconstructing phylogenies using morphological data anymore. As more and more genes and genomes are being sequenced, the possibility that thousands or even millions of informative, independently evolving molecular characters can be brought to bear on a given phylogenetic problem is quickly becoming a reality (e.g., Rokas et al., 2003). Given the rate that new sequence data are being added, and the rate at which new innovations continue to accelerate this process, it seems possible that in the not-too-distant future we will be able to have a perfectly accurate and well-supported phylogeny of most living species on earth using molecular data alone. So why bother with morphology?

A recent paper by Scotland et al. (2003; SEA hereafter) offered a reappraisal of the role of morphology in phylogeny reconstruction. This is certainly an important and timely topic to discuss, and their main thesis is bold and controversial. They state that “We view any attempt to include more morphological data in phylogeny reconstruction as inherently problematic” (p. 545). Unfortunately, most of their arguments are based on unsupported speculation, and they fail to mention numerous studies that clearly contradict their conclusions. Given that many of their comments are written as responses to book chapters written by my collaborators and myself (e.g., Hillis and Wiens, 2000; Poe and Wiens, 2000; Wiens, 2000a), I feel obligated to elucidate some of these problems. Many of the issues raised are central to how systematics is done and will be conducted in the future. I will argue that, despite many undeniable advantages of molecular data, it is still absolutely necessary that we continue to collect additional morphological data for phylogenetic analysis, and continue to improve our methods for morphology-based phylogenetics. Note that Jenner (2004) has provided an independent rebuttal of the SEA paper, and he describes a large number of substantive criticisms which show only limited overlap with my own.

Ardia2007,"Developing a cross-linguistic naming test has represented a challenge in language evaluation. In this paper, it is proposed that a cross-linguistic naming test should fulfill at least the following three criteria: (1) include only “universal” words found across different languages. The basic cross-linguistic core vocabulary is usually referred as the “Swadesh word list”; (2) include different semantic categories (e.g., living and nonliving elements); and (3) avoid the confounding of perceptual difficulties. Departing from the Swadesh word list, a cross-linguistic naming test was developed, including six different semantic categories: (a) body-parts (10 words), (b) natural phenomena (non-touchable) (5 words), (c) external objects (potentially known through the sight and the touch) (5 words), (d) animals (5 words), (e) colors (5 words), and (f) actions (10 words). A total of 40 color pictures were selected to represent these basic words. It is emphasized that this test has two major advantages: on one hand, it is readily available in hundreds of different languages; and, on the other hand, it is not a “fixed” test, but it includes photographs that can be replaced. Theoretically, norms are not required, and it represents a low-ceiling test. Word frequency can be used as a criterion of the level of difficulty. The next step will be to find the performance profile in different language pathologies, as well as the decline pattern in cases of dementia.","basic vocabulary, naming test, aphasia, neurology, cognition, lexicon"
Gonzalez2016,"The traditional view in the philosophy of language has been that linguistic competence is
constituted by rule-governed, algorithmic skills, which underlie the learnable, creative
nature of language. However, increasing evidence about the contextual sensitivity of lin-
guistic understanding has put this traditional view under pressure. I argue that researchers
should turn to anti-computationalist proposals in the cognitive sciences in order to
develop non-algorithmic views of language use that do not make communication and
learning mysterious. Approaches like ecological psychology, enactivism or dynamical
systems theory have shown how complex, open-ended competences can be explained
without positing underlying rule-guided processes, but rather focusing on the complex
interactions and couplings among agents and their environment.
 
These alternative views of linguistic competences make it possible to address metaphor
and other areas of speech that, because of their non-algorithmic nature, have been
considered derivative and have tended to be excluded from the domain of linguistic
meaning. Understanding metaphors requires being able to perceive relevant similarities

ability, which often relies heavily on interpersonal coordination","metaphor, semantic change, "
Ramscar2016,"Historically, linguists and psychologists have generally assumed that language is a com-
binatoric process, thereby taking the idea that language users have access to inventories of
discrete, combinable units (phonemes, morphemes, words, etc.) for granted, despite the
fact that these units have tended to resist formal definitions. We propose a new approach
to language understanding based on the psychological mechanisms that underpin context-sensitive 
processing. This new method is surprisingly simple, in large part because it
embraces a view of learning that has been developed from studies of animal behavior and
neuroscience. From this perspective, learning is seen as a systematic, discriminative 
process that seeks to reduce a learner’s uncertainty in making moment-to-moment 
predictions. We suggest that language processing employs all the information available to the
listener at any given moment to predict what will happen in the next moment, in the next
couple of sentences, etc. This approach does not rely on any of the ambiguous traditional
linguistic units because continuous-time processing simply acts to reduce a hearer’s 
uncertainty about an actual message in relation to possible messages, rather than building up
an interpretation out of elemental components. From this perspective, the conventional
units of language – phonemes, morphemes, words – can be seen as idealizations of 
patterns that evolved for communicative efficiency that can serve the purposes of 
orthographic (and linguistic) description, rather than psychologically ‘real’ elements that are
essential to language processing.","language processing, parsing, psycholinguistics, morpheme, language evolution, language history, phoneme, communicative efficiency"

Lopez2015,"**Background**

Microbial genetic diversity is often investigated via the comparison of relatively similar 16S molecules
through multiple alignments between reference sequences and novel environmental samples using phylogenetic
trees, direct BLAST matches, or phylotypes counts. However, are we missing novel lineages in the microbial dark
universe by relying on standard phylogenetic and BLAST methods? If so, how can we probe that universe using
alternative approaches? We performed a novel type of multi-marker analysis of genetic diversity exploiting the
topology of inclusive sequence similarity networks.

**Results**

Our protocol identified 86 ancient gene families, well distributed and rarely transferred across the 3
domains of life, and retrieved their environmental homologs among 10 million predicted ORFs from human gut
samples and other metagenomic projects. Numerous highly divergent environmental homologs were observed in
gut samples, although the most divergent genes were over-represented in non-gut environments. In our networks,
most divergent environmental genes grouped exclusively with uncultured relatives, in maximal cliques. Sequences
within these groups were under strong purifying selection and presented a range of genetic variation comparable
to that of a prokaryotic domain.

**Conclusions**

Many genes families included environmental homologs that were highly divergent from cultured
homologs: in 79 gene families (including 18 ribosomal proteins), Bacteria and Archaea were less divergent than
some groups of environmental sequences were to any cultured or viral homologs. Moreover, some groups of
environmental homologs branched very deeply in phylogenetic trees of life, when they were not too divergent to
be aligned. These results underline how limited our understanding of the most diverse elements of the microbial
world remains, and encourage a deeper exploration of natural communities and their genetic resources, hinting at
the possibility that still unknown yet major divisions of life have yet to be discovered.","metagenomics, gene similarity network, divergence, homolog detection"
Orzechowska2015,"The goal of this paper is to discuss phonotactic constraints that govern
the formation of word-initial consonant clusters in two different languages,
German and Polish, and to establish a general procedure for a rank-ordering

We define several dimensions in cluster description, namely (i) complexity of
clusters, (ii) place of articulation, (iii) manner of articulation and (iv) voicing of
segments, for which a total of 15 parameters is derived, each expressing a
structural preference for cluster formation true to various degrees in the two
languages. These preferences can be seen in part as extensions of the frequently
used measure of sonority based mainly on manner of articulation features, and
can be considered to provide a more detailed description of clusters than one
based on sonority. In addition, a cluster analysis for the two sets of clusters
lends support to the conclusions on the fundamental difference between Polish
and German word-initial phonotactics. For each cluster, values obtained for
every parameter are summed up to calculate an empirically justified rank
ordering of the clusters in both languages.","phonotactics, rank ordering, German, Polish"
Bentz2015,"Explaining the diversity of languages across the world is one of the central aims of typological, historical, and evolutionary linguistics. We consider the effect of language contact-the
number of non-native speakers a language has-on the way languages change and evolve.
By analysing hundreds of languages within and across language families, regions, and text
types, we show that languages with greater levels of contact typically employ fewer word
forms to encode the same information content (a property we refer to as lexical diversity).
Based on three types of statistical analyses, we demonstrate that this variance can in part
be explained by the impact of non-native speakers on information encoding strategies. Finally, we argue that languages are information encoding systems shaped by the varying
needs of their speakers. Language evolution and change should be modeled as the co-evolution of multiple intertwined adaptive systems: On one hand, the structure of human societies and human learning capabilities, and on the other, the structure of language.","correlational studies, morphological complexity, word family, linguistic complexity"

exaptation as a biologically inspired metaphorical label, and second (Section
4.2), a strictly evolutionary approach, which goes beyond metaphorical exten-

truly evolutionary systems.","exaptation, sound change, phonological change, biological parallels"

better position to undertake a census since linguists have developed a reasonable
idea of the sort of grammatical boundaries that need to be posited (word bound-

etc.). Further, this view generalizes to offer a solution to the problematic notion of
gradience in grammaticalization – cf. Kuryłowicz’s famous definition of grammat-

Cabrera2012,"Sound symbolism seems to be a good candidate for a linguistic universal.
It can be observed in many languages of the world. 1 In addition, no known

to create a large vocabulary. Nevertheless, the persistence of this feature

stage of human language. In this paper, I will first sketch the role of sound
symbolism in the origins of vocabulary following the proposals made by
M. Swadesh in the early seventies and then I will provide linguistic and
archaeological data suggesting the important role of sound symbolism in the
final stages of human symbolic mind evolution. In order to do this I will re-

from different languages, and consequently how many are too many to be all
false cognates. Although very efficient, their model has the shortcoming of being
applicable only to simple lexical lists such as the Swadesh list, with one-to-one
semantic correspondences between the individual terms. Here I present a new
model that can be applied to any kind of word list, and can include comparisons
between multiple terms sharing the same semantic field. After a theoretical
description, a controlled test and a contra-test, I finally apply the method to a
real test case, investigating the probability of relation between Pre-Greek, the

the trials can be generated by randomly shuffling the terms of the two original lists
and redistributing them into the various semantic fields. Note that the semantic
proportions of the original lists have to be respected, so if a specific semantic field
contains 2 terms in the original list, it will contain only 2 terms also in its randomly generated counterpart.","Monte-Carlo permutation, sound classes, proof of relationship"
Pelkey2015b,"Language varieties undergo constant evolution, as do varieties of life. Both language and life, in other words,
unfold by semiosis – pervasive processes of growth in which relationships shared between the inherited past,
the unstable present and the virtual future are organically intertwined. Although many recent attempts have
been made to reunite biotic and linguistic evolution, contemporary treatments are mired in unexamined
presuppositions inherited from 20 th century biological theory. Chief among these is the denial of implicit
end-directed processes, that which biosemiotics finds to be the necessary condition of living systems –
thereby providing semiotic foundations for human inquiry. After reviewing the history and problems of
dialogue between linguistics and biology, I make two primary arguments in this essay, one a critique using
historical evidence, the other a suggestion using empirical evidence. My critical argument is that crucial
features of semiosis are missing from contemporary linguistic-biotic proposals. Entangled with these missing
accounts is an analogous form of neglect, or normative blindness, apparent in both disciplines: the role of
ontogeny in biological evolution and the role of diagrammatization in linguistic evolution. This linguistic-
biotic analogy points to a deeper congruence with the third (and most fundamental) mode of evolution in
Peirce’s scientific ontology: “habit taking” or “Agapasm”. My positive argument builds on this linguistic-
biotic analogy to diagram its corollary membership in light of Peirce’s “three modes of evolution”: Chance
(Tychasm), Law (Anancasm) and Habit Taking (Agapasm). The paper ends with an application involving
complex correspondence patterns in the Muji language varieties of China followed by an appeal for a
radically evolutionary approach to the nature of language(s) in general, an approach that not only
encompasses both linguistic and biotic growth but is also process-explicit.","biological parallels, language evolution, biological evolution"

Vylder2008,"A lot of conventions emerge in gradual stages without being centrally imposed.
The most significant and complex example in our human society is undoubtedly
human language which evolved according to our need for communication. Also
in artificial multi-agent systems, e.g. mobile robots or software agents, it is
often desirable that agents can reach a convention in a distributed way. To
make this possible, it is important to have a sound grasp of the mechanism by
which conventions arise.

In this thesis we define a theoretical framework that enables us to examine
this process carefully. We make a strict distinction between the description
of the convention problem on the one hand and the solution to this problem
in terms of an agent design on the other. A convention problem specifies the
preconditions any type of agent must comply with. This includes (i) the space
of alternatives from which the convention is to be chosen, (ii) the interaction
model between the agents, which determines which agents interact at what time
and (iii) the amount, nature and direction of information transmitted between
the agents during an interaction. A particular agent design solves a convention
problem if a population of such agents will reach an agreement in a reasonable
time, under the given restrictions.

We focus on the class of convention problems with a global interaction model:
every agent is equally likely to interact with any other agent. We argue that
for these convention problems the performance of an agent can be predicted
by inspecting the properties of the agent’s response function. This response
function captures the average behavior of an agent when interacting with agents
from a non-changing population.

We apply this analytical technique to different sorts of convention problems.
For the more simple convention problems we define general, sufficient properties
which guarantee that a convention will arise after a certain amount of time when
an agent possesses these. For the more difficult convention problems we confine
ourselves to the construction of agents who, we can show, will solve the problem.
Finally, our framework is applied to the problem of language evolution in
artificial agents. This is a complicated domain for which precise mathematical
results are very difficult to obtain. We will focus on the naming game, a rela-
tively simple instance in the paradigm of languages games. In certain instances
our analysis will surface problems of convergence that have not been noticed
before. This shows on the one hand that it is important to theoretically sub-
stantiate computer experiments in language evolution and on the other that the framework introduced in this thesis is very suitable to this extent.","multi-agent system, artificial agents, language origin, language model"

Barbieri2008,"Biosemiotics is the idea that life is based on
semiosis, i.e., on signs and codes. This idea has been
strongly suggested by the discovery of the genetic code, but
so far it has made little impact in the scientific world and is
largely regarded as a philosophy rather than a science. The
main reason for this is that modern biology assumes that
signs and meanings do not exist at the molecular level, and
that the genetic code was not followed by any other organic
code for almost four billion years, which implies that it was
an utterly isolated exception in the history of life. These
ideas have effectively ruled out the existence of semiosis in
the organic world, and yet there are experimental facts
against all of them. If we look at the evidence of life
without the preconditions of the present paradigm, we
discover that semiosis is there, in every single cell, and that
it has been there since the very beginning. This is what
biosemiotics is really about. It is not a philosophy. It is a
new scientific paradigm that is rigorously based on
experimental facts. Biosemiotics claims that the genetic
code (1) is a real code and (2) has been the first of a long
series of organic codes that have shaped the history of life
on our planet. The reality of the genetic code and the
existence of other organic codes imply that life is based on
two fundamental processes—copying and coding—and this
in turn implies that evolution took place by two distinct
mechanisms, i.e., by natural selection (based on copying)
and by natural conventions (based on coding). It also
implies that the copying of genes works on individual
molecules, whereas the coding of proteins operates on
collections of molecules, which means that different
mechanisms of evolution exist at different levels of
organization. This review intends to underline the scientific
nature of biosemiotics, and to this purpose, it aims to prove
(1) that the cell is a real semiotic system, (2) that the genetic
code is a real code, (3) that evolution took place by natural
selection and by natural conventions, and (4) that it was
natural conventions, i.e., organic codes, that gave origin to
the great novelties of macroevolution. Biological semiosis,
in other words, is a scientific reality because the codes of
life are experimental realities. The time has come, therefore,
to acknowledge this fact of life, even if that means
abandoning the present theoretical framework in favor of
a more general one where biology and semiotics finally
come together and become biosemiotics.","systemic evolution, biosemiotics, semiotics, code, language as code"
Barbieri2011,"Modern biology has not yet come to terms with the presence of many
organic codes in Nature, despite the fact that we can prove their existence. As a
result, it has not yet accepted the idea that the great events of macroevolution were
associated with the origin of new organic codes, despite the fact that this is the most
parsimonious and logical explanation of those events. This is probably due to the
fact that the existence of organic codes in all fundamental processes of life, and in all
major transitions in the history of life, has enormous theoretical implications. It
requires nothing less than a new theoretical framework, and that kind of change is
inevitably slow. There are too many facts to reconsider, too many bits of history to
weave together in a new mosaic. But this is what science is about, and the purpose of
the present paper is to show that it can be done. More precisely, it is shown that the
whole natural history of the brain can be revisited in the light of the organic codes.
What is described here is only a bird’s-eye view of brain macroevolution, but it is
hoped that the extraordinary potential of the organic codes can nevertheless come
through. The paper contains also another message. The organic codes prove that life
is based on semiosis, and are in fact the components of organic semiosis, the first
and the most diffused form of semiosis on Earth, but not the only one. It will be
shown that the evolution of the brain was accompanied by the development of two
new types of sign processes. More precisely, it gave origin first to interpretive
semiosis, mostly in vertebrates, and then to cultural semiosis, in our species.","cultural semiosis, semiotics, biosemiotics, evolution, evolution of the brain, system modelling"

new qualities of living, which are unaccessible through the methods of contemporary,

the effect of concept vagueness, salience, affect and semantic

predictors in a linear regression analysis. Our response variable
is a composite variable that takes into account the number of
variants per concept and the degree to which the concepts are
scattered across geographical space in a heterogeneous way. Our
model reveals that vaguer, less salient and non-neutral concepts
show significantly more variation and that the lexical variants for
these concepts are scattered across geographical space in a less
homogeneous way. We also find differences between semantic
fields.","semantics, concepts, lexical variation, geographic variation, onomasialogical approach, onomasiology"

Barbieri2008b,"The existence of different types of semiosis has been recognized, so far, in
two ways. It has been pointed out that different semiotic features exist in different
taxa and this has led to the distinction between zoosemiosis, phytosemiosis,
mycosemiosis, bacterial semiosis and the like. Another type of diversity is due to the
existence of different types of signs and has led to the distinction between iconic,
indexical and symbolic semiosis. In all these cases, however, semiosis has been
defined by the Peirce model, i.e., by the idea that the basic structure is a triad of
‘sign, object and interpretant’, and that interpretation is an essential component of
semiosis. This model is undoubtedly applicable to animals, since it was precisely the
discovery that animals are capable of interpretation that allowed Thomas Sebeok to
conclude that they are also capable of semiosis. Unfortunately, however, it is not
clear how far the Peirce model can be extended beyond the animal kingdom, and we
already know that we cannot apply it to the cell. The rules of the genetic code have
been virtually the same in all living systems and in all environments ever since the
origin of life, which clearly shows that they do not depend on interpretation. Luckily,
it has been pointed out that semiosis is not necessarily based on interpretation and
can be defined exclusively in terms of coding. According to the ‘code model’, a
semiotic system is made of signs, meanings and coding rules, all produced by the
same codemaker, and in this form it is immediately applicable to the cell. The code
model, furthermore, allows us to recognize the existence of many organic codes in
living systems, and to divide them into two main types that here are referred to as
manufacturing semiosis and signalling semiosis. The genetic code and the splicing
codes, for example, take part in processes that actually manufacture biological
objects, whereas signal transduction codes and compartment codes organize existing
objects into functioning supramolecular structures. The organic codes of single cells
appeared in the first three billion years of the history of life and were involved either
in manufacturing semiosis or in signalling semiosis. With the origin of animals,
however, a third type of semiosis came into being, a type that can be referred to as
interpretive semiosis because it became closely involved with interpretation. We
realize in this way that the contribution of semiosis to life was far greater than that
predicted by the Peirce model, where semiosis is always a means of interpreting the
world. Life is essentially about three things: (1) it is about manufacturing objects, (2)
it is about organizing objects into functioning systems, and (3) it is about interpreting
the world. The idea that these are all semiotic processes, tells us that life depends on
semiosis much more deeply and extensively than we thought. We realize in this way
that there are three distinct types of semiosis in Nature, and that they gave very
different contributions to the origin and the evolution of life.","semiosis, semiotics, biological parallels, biosemiotics"
Hoffmeyer2015,"A central idea in biosemiotic writings has been the idea of growth in semiotic freedom
as a persistent trend in evolution (Hoffmeyer 1992). By semiotic freedom we mean the
capacity of species or organisms to derive useful information by help of semiosis or, in
other words, by processes of interpretation in the widest (Peircean) sense of this term.
While even bacteria have a certain very limited ability to interpret cues in the medium
this ability obviously becomes more developed in more complex organisms, and is
typically most developed in big-brained animals that are late arrivals at the evolutionary
scene. The evolution of a richer semiotic capacity is of course only one among many
strategies available in the evolutionary game. Yet, this particular strategy potentially
ignites a self-perpetuating evolutionary dynamics, since each step taken by a species
along this route potentially opens new agendas for further change:
the more capable some species are of anticipating and interpreting complex and fast-
changing situations or events, the more will evolution favor the development in other
species of a well-adjusted set of semiotic tools.","semiotics, scaffolding, biosemiotics, biological parallels"

Stern2015,"Historical Linguistics studies language change over time. If a group of languages
derives from changes to a common ancestor language (proto-language) then they
are said to be related. Whenever there exists a lack of written records for an ancestor language, a relevant question in Historical Linguistics is to determine whether
two languages are related.

The gold standard for finding these relationships is the Comparative Method.
Despite the success of the Comparative Method in finding language relationships,
it suffers from at least two limitations. First, the Comparative Method involves the
manual comparison of various features from a group of languages. Second, the
Comparative Method doesn’t provide a numerical measure of evidence for how
much the database under consideration corroborates an hypothesis.
Given the above limitations, the field of Computational Historical Linguistics is
presented as a complement to the Comparative Method. This field has experienced
a recent expansion with the adaptation of methods from biological phylogenetics.
Nevertheless, there is debate whether the evolutionary models used in phylogenetics also incorporate valid linguistical assumptions.

In this thesis, I propose a new (probability) model for the evolution of the
phonology of languages. A relevant innovation of this model is that it captures
the regularity of sound changes. I also describe the software that I created in order
to assist in incorporating into the model a linguist’s expert knowledge. I show that
the knowledge obtained in this way agrees with qualitative statements known to
linguists. Finally, I present a new algorithm used to compute the probability of
linguistic hypotheses regarding language relationships and the occurence of regular sound changes. The main problem that this algorithm overcomes is that it
efficiently explores the possible regular sound changes, mutations in languages
that simultaneously affect several words. In order to overcome this challange, I
present a new variant of Nested Sequential Monte Carlo that is used to explore the
large space of language relationships and regular sound changes. To the best of my
knowledge, this is the first algorithm that can perform joint inference on regular
sound changes and evolutionary trees. I show that this algorithm is a special case
of Sequential Importance Resampling.

MacklinCordes2015,"Typological datasets for quantitative historical-
linguistic inquiry are growing in breadth, but a challenge is also
to increase their depth, since advanced methods often ideally
require many hundreds of traits per language. Using biphone
transition probabilities from phonemicized vocabulary data, we
extract several hundred high-definition phonotactic traits per
language, for 17 languages in the Ngumpin-Yapa and Yolngu
subgroups of the Pama-Nyungan family, Australia. We detect
phylogenetic signal at a significant level (p < 0.001 for both
subgroups), measured against a reference phylogeny inferred
from basic vocabulary cognacy data. This contrasts with simpler,
binary coding of biphones’ occurrence, which provides
insufficient detail for the detection of phylogenetic signal. Thus,
we demonstrate the viability of a new method in quantitative
historical linguistics, and emphasize the inferential power to be
harnessed from high-definition, trait-rich datasets for

Ng2015,"This dissertation identifies three previously unexplained typological differences between
creoles, other types of language contact, and ‘normal’ sound change. (1) The merger gap:
French /y/ merges with /i/ in all creoles worldwide, whereas merger with /u/ is also well-attested in other forms of language contact. The rarity of /u/ outcomes in French creoles is
unexplained, especially because they are well attested in French varieties spoken in West
Africa. (2) The assimilation gap: In creoles the quality of the stressed vowel often spreads to
unstressed vowels, e.g. Spanish dedo > Papiamentu /dede/ ‘finger’. Strikingly, we do not find
the opposite in creoles, but it is well attested among non-creoles, e.g. German umlaut and
Romance metaphony. (3) The epenthesis gap: Word-final consonants are often preserved in
language contact by means of vowel insertion (epenthesis), e.g. English big > Sranan bigi, but
in normal language transmission this sound change is said not to occur word-finally.
 
These three case studies make it possible to test various theories of sound change on
new data, by relating language contact outcomes to the phonetics of non-native perception
and second language speech production. I also explore the implications of social interactions
and historical developments unique to creolisation, with comparisons to other language
contact situations.

Based on the typological gaps identified here, I propose that sociohistorical context,
e.g. age of learner or nature of input, is critical in determining linguistic outcomes. Like
phonetic variation, it can be biased in ways which produce asymmetries in sound change.
Specifically, in language contact dominated by adult second language acquisition, we find
transmission biases towards phonological rather than perceptual matching, overcompensation for perceptual weakness, and overgeneralisation of domain-final prominence.

Alva2015,"The seemingly limitless diversity of proteins in nature arose from only a few thousand domain prototypes, but the origin of these themselves has remained unclear. We are pursuing the hypothesis that they arose by fusion and accretion from an ancestral set of peptides active as co-factors in RNA-dependent replication and catalysis. Should this be true, contemporary domains may still contain vestiges of such peptides, which could be reconstructed by a comparative approach in the same way in which ancient vocabularies have been reconstructed by the comparative study of modern languages. To test this, we compared domains representative of known folds and identified 40 fragments whose similarity is indicative of common descent, yet which occur in domains currently not thought to be homologous. These fragments are widespread in the most ancient folds and enriched for iron-sulfur- and nucleic acid-binding. We propose that they represent the observable remnants of a primordial RNA-peptide world.","domains, partial homology, gene fusion, biological parallels, analogy"

in parallel text samples, the complexities of overall 646 languages are estimated. A large-scale
finding of this analysis is that languages just above the equator exhibit lower complexity than
languages further away from the equator. This geo-spatial pattern is here referred to as the
Low-Complexity-Belt (LCB). The statistical significance of the positive latitude/complexity re-

that the pattern holds between different families and areas, but not within different families and
areas. The lack of systematic within-family effects is taken as potential evidence for a phylogenetically “deep” explanation. The pressures shaping language complexities probably pre-date
the expansion of language families from their proto-languages. Large-scale prehistoric contact

Zou2016,"Morphological decomposition is an important part of complex word processing. In Chinese, this requires a comprehensive consideration of phonological, orthographic and morphemic information. The left inferior frontal gyrus (L-IFG) has been implicated in this process in alphabetic languages. However, it is unclear whether the neural mechanisms underlying morphological processing in alphabetic languages would be the same in Chinese, a logographic language. To investigate the neural basis of morphological processing in Chinese compound words, an fMRI experiment was conducted using an explicit auditory morphological judgment task. Results showed the L-IFG to be a core area in Chinese morphological processing, consistent with research in alphabetic languages. Additionally, a broad network consisting of the L-MTG, the bilateral STG and the L-FG that taps phonological, orthographic, and semantic information was found to be involved. These results provide evidence that the L-IFG plays an important role in morphological processing even in languages that are typologically different.","morphological decomposition, morphological processing, morpheme, "
Nettle1998,"The six and a half thousand languages spoken by humankind are very unevenly distributed
across the globe. Language diversity generally increases as one moves from the poles toward the
equator and is very low in arid environments. Two belts of extremely high language diversity
can be identified. One runs through West and Central Africa, while the other covers South and
South-East Asia and the Pacific. Most of the world’s languages are found in these two areas. This
paper attempts to explain aspects of the global distribution of language diversity. It is proposed
that a key factor influencing it has been climatic variability. Where the climate allows contin-
uous food production throughout the year, small groups of people can be reliably self-sufficient
and so populations fragment into many small languages. Where the variability of the climate is
greater, the size of social network necessary for reliable subsistence is larger, and so languages
tend to be more widespread. A regression analysis relating the number of languages spoken in
the major tropical countries to the variability of their climates is performed and the results
support the hypothesis. The geographical patterning of languages has, however, begun to be
destroyed by the spread of Eurasian diseases, Eurasian people, and the world economy.","language diversity, typology, correlational studies"
Pelkey2013,"Cross-linguistic evidence from widespread modes of language variation and change demonstrate that language evolution proceeds (at least in part, perhaps in whole) by breaking and renewing symmetrical patterns.

After summarizing the theoretical context of my thesis, including relationships between analogy, symmetry, and linguistic diagrammatization, I present supporting comparative data in successive stages of complexity, ranging from simple reversals of linguistic diagrams through time to the emergence of more involved linguistic mirror patterns, to the emergence of intertwining diagrams and linguistic fractal symmetries. I then point back to the embodied and psychological sources of these patterns in the primary modeling system of the human Umwelt.

Moore2012,"The wealth of available genomic data presents an unrivaled opportunity to study the molecular basis of evolution. Studies
on gene family expansions and site-dependent analyses have already helped establish important insights into how proteins
facilitate adaptation. However, efforts to conduct full-scale cross-genomic comparisons between species are challenged by
both growing amounts of data and the inherent difficulty in accurately inferring homology between deeply rooted species.
Proteins, in comparison, evolve by means of domain rearrangements, a process more amenable to study given the strength of
profile-based homology inference and the lower rates with which rearrangements occur. However, adapting to a constantly
changing environment can require molecular modulations beyond reach of rearrangement alone. Here, we explore rates and
functional implications of novel domain emergence in contrast to domain gain and loss in 20 arthropod species of the pan-
crustacean clade. Emerging domains are more likely disordered in structure and spread more rapidly within their genomes
than established domains. Furthermore, although domain turnover occurs at lower rates than gene family turnover, we find
strong evidence that the emergence of novel domains is foremost associated with environmental adaptation such as abiotic
stress response. The results presented here illustrate the simplicity with which domain-based analyses can unravel key players

events will tend to occur early and will be offset by a large
number of domain loss events. However, we consider Dollo
parsimony as used here sufficiently robust. First, in this study
we do not consider copy number variation; we consider only
the binary state, presence or absence, of a given domain in
any given node. Hence, a domain can only be lost along a
branch if 1) it has been gained at an ancestral node to the
branch considered and 2) not a single copy is present in
the descendant node (or its subtree). Second, in most cases,
domains represent the functional unit within a given pro-

compared the usage and distribution of protein domain families in the free-living proteomes of Archaea, Bacteria and
Eukarya and reconstructed species phylogenies while tracing the history of domain emergence and loss in proteomes. We
show that both gains and losses of domains occurred frequently during proteome evolution. The rate of domain discovery
increased approximately linearly in evolutionary time. Remarkably, gains generally outnumbered losses and the gain-to-loss
ratios were much higher in akaryotes compared to eukaryotes. Functional annotations of domain families revealed that
both Archaea and Bacteria gained and lost metabolic capabilities during the course of evolution while Eukarya acquired a
number of diverse molecular functions including those involved in extracellular processes, immunological mechanisms, and
cell regulation. Results also highlighted significant contemporary sharing of informational enzymes between Archaea and
Eukarya and metabolic enzymes between Bacteria and Eukarya. Finally, the analysis provided useful insights into the
evolution of species. The archaeal superkingdom appeared first in evolution by gradual loss of ancestral domains, bacterial
lineages were the first to gain superkingdom-specific domains, and eukaryotes (likely) originated when an expanding proto-
eukaryotic stem lineage gained organelles through endosymbiosis of already diversified bacterial lineages. The evolutionary
dynamics of domain families in proteomes and the increasing number of domain gains is predicted to redefine the
persistence strategies of organisms in superkingdoms, influence the make up of molecular functions, and enhance
organismal complexity by the generation of new domain architectures. This dynamics highlights ongoing secondary

Tordai2005,"Originally the term ‘protein module’ was coined to distinguish mobile

domain’, the distinction between static and mobile domains is rather vague
as it is not easy to quantify the mobility of domains. In the present work
we show that the most appropriate measure of the mobility of domains is
the number of types of local environments in which a given domain is pre-
sent. Ranking of domains with respect to this parameter in different evo-
lutionary lineages highlighted marked differences in the propensity of
domains to form multidomain proteins. Our analyses have also shown that
there is a correlation between domain size and domain mobility: smaller
domains are more likely to be used in the construction of multidomain pro-
teins, whereas larger domains are more likely to be static, stand-alone
domains. It is also shown that shuffling of a limited set of modules was
facilitated by intronic recombination in the metazoan lineage and this has

Wolf1999,"A sensitive protein-fold recognition procedure was developed on the basis of iterative database search using the PSI-BLAST program. A collection of 1193 position-dependent weight matrices that can be used as fold identifiers was produced. In the completely sequenced genomes, folds could be automatically identified for 20%-30% of the proteins, with 3%-6% more detectable by additional analysis of conserved motifs. The distribution of the most common folds is very similar in bacteria and archaea but distinct in eukaryotes. Within the bacteria, this distribution differs between parasitic and free-living species. In all analyzed genomes, the P-loop NTPases are the most abundant fold. In bacteria and archaea, the next most common folds are ferredoxin-like domains, TIM-barrels, and methyltransferases, whereas in eukaryotes, the second to fourth places belong to protein kinases, beta-propellers and TIM-barrels. The observed diversity of protein folds in different proteomes is approximately twice as high as it would be expected from a simple stochastic model describing a proteome as a finite sample from an infinite pool of proteins with an exponential distribution of the fold fractions. Distribution of the number of domains with different folds in one protein fits the geometric model, which is compatible with the evolution of multidomain proteins by random combination of domains.

Basu2009,"A substantial fraction of eukaryotic proteins contains multiple domains, some of which show a tendency to occur
in diverse domain architectures and can be considered mobile (or ‘promiscuous’). These promiscuous domains are
typically involved in protein ^ protein interactions and play crucial roles in interaction networks, particularly those
contributing to signal transduction. They also play a major role in creating diversity of protein domain architecture in
the proteome. It is now apparent that promiscuity is a volatile and relatively fast-changing feature in evolution, and
that only a few domains retain their promiscuity status throughout evolution. Many such domains attained their
promiscuity status independently in different lineages. Only recently, we have begun to understand the diversity of
protein domain architectures and the role the promiscuous domains play in evolution of this diversity. However,
many of the biological mechanisms of protein domain mobility remain shrouded in mystery. In this review, we discuss
our present understanding of protein domain promiscuity, its evolution and its role in cellular function.","mobile domain, domains, proteins, domain mobilty"
Basu2009,"Protein domains are the structural and functional
units of proteins. It is now well established that
proteins carry out their functions primarily through
their constituent domains. They can be gained by
proteins to acquire new function. Domains are,
therefore, considered to be the units through which
proteins evolve. In structural biology, domains are
defined as independent folding units in a protein.
However, domains are generally identified as highly
conserved regions of the protein sequence. This
apparent contradiction in definition of protein
domain disappears upon scrutiny: domains identified
by sequence conservation alone have been shown to
have distinct structural identity [1, 2].","domains, proteins, protein structure, definition"
Basu2009,"The number of unique domains in an organism
is roughly proportional to its genome size. In
unicellular eukaryotes, such as apicomplexans, diplo-
monads and protozoans, the unique number of
domains is ~1000, whereas in plants, fungi and
animals, the numbers can be as high as ~3000. The
average size of domain is ~100 amino acids [11].
The number of domains per gene (modularity)
follows the power-law (see below) distribution [12],
and it has been shown that tissue-specific genes
have higher modularity [12, 13].","domains, frequency, power law, statistics"
Basu2009,"Given the large number of domains present in an
organism, the possible combinatorial arrangements
are enormous. However, in eukaryotic genomes
domains are present only in a limited set of
arrangements in multidomain proteins. This suggests
that evolutionary constraints play an important role
in the selection of domain architectures observed in
multidomain proteins [2]. Indeed, domain arrange-
ments, even the domain ordering in multidomain
proteins, determine their three dimensional arrange-
ments, and therefore, might affect function [25]. In
earlier studies, it was shown that most of the domain
combinations in multidomain proteins have been
formed only once in the evolution, and the domain
combinations are inherited rather than formed
through convergent evolution [14, 26].","domain emergence, parallel evolution, homoplasy"
Basu2009,"However,
in a recent study, Forslund and co-workers claimed
that convergent evolution is more prevalent than
previously thought [27]. They investigated the
prevalence of domain architecture reinvention in
96 genomes with a novel domain tree-based method
that uses maximum parsimony for inferring ancestral
protein architectures. They detected multiple origins
for 12.4% of the architectures. This result indicates
that domain architecture reinvention is a much more
common phenomenon than previously thought [27].
Thus, it is possible that the process of convergent
domain architecture evolution is driven by func-
tional necessity.","domain emergence, parallel evolution, homoplasy"
Basu2009,"Domains are present in various combinations in
multidomain proteins. While some domains are
present in stable configuration, others are present in
many different domain milieus. Promiscuous or
mobile domains are domains that reside in many
different domain combinations [20, 24, 28]. The
term promiscuity carries several connotations when
applied to a protein domain. In scientific literature,
promiscuity can signify domains with higher degree
of mobility (as described above), or domains that
physically interact with many other domains
(protein–protein interactions), or domains that bind
different types of molecules. In this article, the term
promiscuous domain will be used to mean mobile
domains.","definition, mobile domain, promiscuous domain"

a particular metabolite is involved, number of
pseudogenes in a particular gene family, and many
others [31–39]. Two very common versions of the
power-law are Zipf’s law, which describes the
frequency distribution of words in a text [40] and
the Pareto distribution, which describes the distribu-
tion of people by wealth [41]. Pareto distribution
also led to the famous Pareto principle, which says
‘few contain many and most contain few’ or the so
called 80-20 rule. Examples of such rule are 20%

Basu2009,"Domain co-occurrence networks also fall under
the scale-free category [21]. These networks are
graphs in which each node represents a domain, and
two nodes are connected by an edge only if they are
present is a single protein sequence [20, 21, 43, 44].
In a scale-free network, there are few nodes that are
highly connected, but majority of them have low
connectivity. Additionally, in a scale-free network,
the features of the network and the underlying dis-
tribution do not change with the increasing number
of nodes. In a protein domain co-occurrence
network, promiscuous mobile domains are highly
connected nodes or hubs. [...]
This type of
distribution of connectivity is very different from
random network where the connectivity is largely
uniform. Moreover, the scale-free nature of such a
network is largely assumed to exist due to ‘prefer-
ential attachment’, which dictates that the probability
of a node acquiring new connections is proportional
to its degree (the number of nodes to which a given
node is connected). Thus the implication of such
connectivity for a domain co-occurrence network
is important in showing that domain combinations
in proteins are not random and that promiscuous
domains have a tendency to become more promiscuous during evolution.","domain co-occurrence network, network, co-occurrence, "

largely unknown, several mechanisms have been
proposed with anecdotal evidence. Examples of
such mechanisms are gene fusion and fission, de

and recruitment of the mobile genetic elements [45].
Domains are frequently gained by proteins through
insertions at the N or C terminus [46, 47]. Repeated
domains can also arise through duplication [48].
Novel structure can also arise due to circular

consider several parameters. Some of these
parameters are as follows: (a) other domains that

architectures in which a domain participates and
(c) the abundance of a domain in the genome.

parameters is largely misleading, because it is known
that many domains, though participating in large
multidomain architectures, in fact exist in fewer local
contexts [20]. It is, therefore, necessary to consider
immediate domain neighbors (domains adjacent
to a given domain on a polypeptide sequence) to
correctly identify promiscuous domains.","promiscuous domain, domain co-occurrence network"

study, Tordai and co-workers [20] took this fact into

promiscuous domains as those who participate in
many of these triplets. This is akin to using parameter
(b). But even this study, which took local environ-
ment into account, largely ignored the abundance of
domain in the genome [20], a very important
criterion to determine domain promiscuity correctly.","promiscuous domain, domain co-occurrence network"
Basu2009,"Recently, we developed a method to objectively measure mobility/promiscuity of a protein
domain [28], taking the abundance of a domain into
consideration. The method uses techniques from
computational linguistics to measure promiscuity
from domain co-occurrence. The method, called
‘bigram analysis’, is generally used to find words with
more semantic importance in any language [58].
It has also been employed in finding words that
are semantically linked to each other. The idea is to
count the number of times a pair of words (bigram)
occurs in a text (corpus). If a pair occurs less
frequently from the background distribution, it
carries more semantic information than the others.
Additionally, this analysis also points out the words

Alves2009,"**Background**
Protein domains represent the basic units in the evolution of proteins. Domain
duplication and shuffling by recombination and fusion, followed by divergence are the most
common mechanisms in this process. Such domain fusion and recombination events are predicted
to occur only once for a given multidomain architecture. However, other scenarios may be
relevant in the evolution of specific proteins, such as convergent evolution of multidomain
architectures. With this in mind, we study glutaredoxin (GRX) domains, because these domains of
approximately one hundred amino acids are widespread in archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes and
participate in fusion proteins. GRXs are responsible for the reduction of protein disulfides or
glutathione-protein mixed disulfides and are involved in cellular redox regulation, although their
specific roles and targets are often unclear.

**Result** In this work we analyze the distribution and evolution of GRX proteins in archaea,
bacteria and eukaryotes. We study over one thousand GRX proteins, each containing at least one
GRX domain, from hundreds of different organisms and trace the origin and evolution of the GRX
domain within the tree of life.

**Conclusion**
Our results suggest that single domain GRX proteins of the CGFS and CPYC classes
have, each, evolved through duplication and divergence from one initial gene that was present in
the last common ancestor of all organisms. Remarkably, we identify a case of convergent evolution
in domain architecture that involves the GRX domain. Two independent recombination events of
a TRX domain to a GRX domain are likely to have occurred, which is an exception to the dominant
mechanism of domain architecture evolution.","domains, domain combination, gene fusion, gene shuffling"
Bashton2007,"During evolution, many new proteins have been formed by the process of gene duplication and combination. The genes involved in this process usually code for whole domains. Small proteins contain one domain; medium and large proteins contain two or more domains. We have compared homologous domains that occur in both one-domain proteins and multidomain proteins. We have determined (1) how the functions of the individual domains in the multidomain proteins combine to produce their overall functions and (2) the extent to which these functions are similar to those in the one-domain homologs. We describe how domain combinations increase the specificity of enzymes; act as links between domains that have functional roles; regulate activity; combine within one chain functions that can act either independently, in concert or in new contexts; and provide the structural framework for the evolution of entirely new functions.","domains, domain combination, protein structure, protein functions"

Bashton2007,"Here, we frequently find that the general function of the
homolog of the one-domain protein in the multidomain
protein has been conserved but has been modified or
made more specific. This is achieved by placing the homologous domain into a new domain context or ‘‘syntax,’’
in which an additional domain serves to expand, alter, or
modulate its functionality. Syntax governs the arrangements in a sentence of words that individually have particular meanings and taken together make ‘‘sense’’; this can
be modified further by the replacement or the addition of
other suitable words. The addition of unsuitable words
will produce nonsense.","biological parallels, domain combination, syntax, analogy, word combination"
Bashton2007,"In the small number of cases in which the functions of
the domain are totally changed, we find that the common
scaffold of the protein domain has been adapted to carry
out a different, unrelated reaction or bind a different, unrelated ligand. This is a redesign of the protein’s function
through progressive mutation of the domain itself to generate quite different functions. It can be thought of as
a change in semantics, i.e., that the function or ‘‘meaning’’
of the domain itself has changed. This is found in words
that have quite different meanings according to their context: e.g., ‘‘she is a red’’ (i.e., a communist); ‘‘the pillar-box
is red’’ (i.e., is painted red).","semantic change, protein functions, domain combination, functional shift"

Sinsheimer2012,"Gene sequences are routinely used to determine the topologies of unrooted phylogenetic trees, but many of the most important
questions in evolution require knowing both the topologies and the roots of trees. However, general algorithms for calculating rooted
trees from gene and genomic sequences in the absence of gene paralogs are few. Using the principles of evolutionary parsimony (EP) and its extensions, we explicitly
enumerate all linear invariants that solely contain rooting information and derive algorithms for rooting gene trees directly from gene
and genomic sequences. These new EP linear rooting invariants allow one to determine rooted trees, even in the complete absence of
outgroups and gene paralogs. EP rooting invariants are explicitly derived for three taxon trees, and rules for their extension to four or
more taxa are provided. The method is demonstrated using 18S ribosomal DNA to illustrate how the new animal phylogeny
may be rooted directly from sequences, even when they
are short and paralogs are unavailable. These results are consistent with the current root.","rooting of phylogenetic trees"
Yap2005,"**Background:** We compared two methods of rooting a phylogenetic tree: the stationary and the
nonstationary substitution processes. These methods do not require an outgroup.
**Methods:** Given a multiple alignment and an unrooted tree, the maximum likelihood estimates of
branch lengths and substitution parameters for each associated rooted tree are found; rooted trees
are compared using their likelihood values. Site variation in substitution rates is handled by assigning
sites into several classes before the analysis.
**Results:** In three test datasets where the trees are small and the roots are assumed known, the
nonstationary process gets the correct estimate significantly more often, and fits data much better,
than the stationary process. Both processes give biologically plausible root placements in a set of
nine primate mitochondrial DNA sequences.
Conclusions: The nonstationary process is simple to use and is much better than the stationary
process at inferring the root. It could be useful for situations where an outgroup is unavailable.","rooting of phylogenetic trees, nonstationary substitution process, stationary substitution process"

phonological and syntactic reconstruction, made possible by an ‘item-based’
view of syntactic variation as assumed within Minimalist theories of syntax as
well as Construction Grammar and others. A case study dealing with the ‘middle

genetic relationships among taxa. Models of evolution are sets of assumptions
about the process of nucleotide or amino acid substitution (see Chapters 4 and 9).
They describe the different probabilities of change from one nucleotide or amino
acid to another along a phylogenetic tree, allowing us to choose among different
phylogenetic hypotheses to explain the data at hand. Comprehensive reviews of
models of evolution are offered elsewhere (Swofford et al., 1996; Liò & Goldman,

various works, have defended the notion of ‘ syntactic pattern ’ as the analogue of the
correspondence set, arguing that patterns can be compared across languages, with
innovations being stripped away to reveal aspects of the protolanguage. In this arti-

indeed utilizing core notions in generative approaches to syntactic change such as the
central role of reanalysis and child language acquisition and the distinction between
the abstract grammatical system and the surface output of that system. Reanalysis
itself is constrained by the fact that both pre- and post-reanalysis grammars must be
acquirable on the basis of the same primary linguistic data. This imposes limits on the
possible hypotheses that can be entertained (‘local directionality ’) even in the absence
of any crosslinguistic generalizations about patterns of change (‘universal direction-
ality’). This approach is then applied to aspects of the syntax of free relative clauses
and negation in the early Brythonic Celtic languages (Welsh, Breton and Cornish),

Ōgami has a relatively small-sized phoneme inventory. It has the very rare characteristic of allowing syllables and words without vowels nor any other voiced sound. Previous analyses positing devoiced vowels in the nucleus of such syllables are refuted on the basis of acoustic and morphophonological evidence. The different word classes, case markers and pragmatic role markers, as well as their morphology, are described in several chapters. An overview of the syntax of the noun phrase and the sentence is given. Special attention is paid to the clause chaining system and desubordination of converbs: some converbs have acquired the ability to head independent sentences, with, for example, a past tense value. This is followed by several chapters on diachronic issues. First, a phylogenetic classification of the Ryukyuan languages and then of the Miyako dialects is proposed. The phonology, noun morphology and verbal system of proto-Miyako are then reconstructed on the basis of data from five dialects.

Genome sequencing, direct confirmation of physical linkage, and phylogenetic analysis revealed that a large fraction of the H. dujardini genome is derived from diverse bacteria as well as plants, fungi, and Archaea. We estimate that approximately one-sixth of tardigrade genes entered by HGT, nearly double the fraction found in the most extreme cases of HGT into animals known to date. Foreign genes have supplemented, expanded, and even replaced some metazoan gene families within the tardigrade genome. Our results demonstrate that an unexpectedly large fraction of an animal genome can be derived from foreign sources. We speculate that animals that can survive extremes may be particularly prone to acquiring foreign genes. ","lateral gene transfer, tardigrade, phylogenetic reconstruction, phylogenetic network"

Koutsovoulos2015,"Background Tardigrades are meiofaunal ecdysozoans that may be key to understanding the origins of Arthropoda. Many species of Tardigrada can survive extreme conditions through adoption of a cryptobiotic state. A recent high profile paper suggested that the genome of a model tardigrade, Hypsibius dujardini, has been shaped by unprecedented levels of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) encompassing 17% of protein coding genes, and speculated that this was likely formative in the evolution of stress resistance. We tested these findings using an independently sequenced and assembled genome of H. dujardini, derived from the same original culture isolate. Results Whole-organism sampling of meiofaunal species will perforce include gut and surface microbiotal contamination, and our raw data contained bacterial and algal sequences. Careful filtering generated a cleaned H. dujardini genome assembly, validated and annotated with GSSs, ESTs and RNA-Seq data, with superior assembly metrics compared to the published, HGT-rich assembly. A small amount of additional microbial contamination likely remains in our 135 Mb assembly. Our assembly length fits well with multiple empirical measurements of H. dujardini genome size, and is 120 Mb shorter than the HGT-rich version. Among 23,021 protein coding gene predictions we found 216 genes (0.9%) with similarity to prokaryotes, 196 of which were expressed, suggestive of HGT. We also identified ~400 genes (<2%) that could be HGT from other non-metazoan eukaryotes. Cross-comparison of the assemblies, using raw read and RNA-Seq data, confirmed that the overwhelming majority of the putative HGT candidates in the previous genome were predicted from scaffolds at very low coverage and were not transcribed. Crucially much of the natural contamination in both projects was non-overlapping, confirming it as foreign to the shared target animal genome. Conclusions We find no support for massive horizontal gene transfer into the genome of H. dujardini. Many of the bacterial sequences in the previously published genome were not present in our raw reads. In construction of our assembly we removed most, but still not all, contamination with approaches derived from metagenomics, which we show are very appropriate for meiofaunal species. We conclude that HGT into H. dujardini accounts for 1-2% of genes and that the proposal that 17% of tardigrade genes originate from HGT events is an artefact of undetected contamination.","lateral gene transfer, tardigrade, phylogenetic reconstruction, data problems, sequencing error, errors"

properties universal to human cognition. Semantics, or meaning
expressed through language, provides indirect access to the underlying conceptual structure, but meaning is notoriously difficult
to measure, let alone parameterize. Here, we provide an empirical
measure of semantic proximity between concepts using cross-linguistic dictionaries to translate words to and from languages
carefully selected to be representative of worldwide diversity. These
translations reveal cases where a particular language uses a single
“polysemous” word to express multiple concepts that another lan-
guage represents using distinct words. We use the frequency of such
polysemies linking two concepts as a measure of their semantic
proximity and represent the pattern of these linkages by a weighted
network. This network is highly structured: Certain concepts are far
more prone to polysemy than others, and naturally interpretable
clusters of closely related concepts emerge. Statistical analysis
of the polysemies observed in a subset of the basic vocabulary shows
that these structural properties are consistent across different language groups, and largely independent of geography, environment,
and the presence or absence of a literary tradition. The methods
developed here can be applied to any semantic domain to reveal
the extent to which its conceptual structure is, similarly, a universal
attribute of human cognition and language use.","semantic network, polysemy, quantitative analysis"

dual user-designer relation, towards embedding this function in its

ancestor is imagined to have possessed significantly many of the complex
characteristics of contemporary eukaryotes, as relics of an earlier ‘progenotic’
period or RNA world. Bacteria and Archaea thus must have lost these complex
features secondarily, through ‘streamlining’. If the canonical three-domain tree

not only blubber, fur and feathers, but even radically different features, such as behaviour. The less specific a trait, the
more likely it is to convergently evolve, all else being equal.

strengthened by its retrieval. If encountering a
word results in the automatic activation of all
related words, then the connections stemming
from high-frequency words will be accessed more
often than for low-frequency words. The links
between high-frequency words and their associates
should therefore be particularly strong. De Groot’s
study instead demonstrated that the imageability of
a word was more important in the distribution and
speed of word association responses. Imageability
refers to the ease with which a word evokes a
mental image (Paivio, Yuille, & Madigan, 1968).","imageability, correlational studies, word frequency, word association"
Playfoot2013,"In  discrete  word  association  tasks,  a  smaller
number of different responses are elicited by words
that are highly imageable. Correspondingly, the
dominant response to a high-imageability cue word
has a greater associative strength than that for a less imageable cue, and in addition, the responses are
generated  more  quickly  (Altarriba,  Bauer,  &
Benvenuto, 1999; Brysbaert et al., 2000; de Groot,
1989). These
findings were interpreted as evidence
that the links between highly imageable nodes and
related concepts were stronger than the links stemming from low-imageable nodes.","word association, imageability, correlational studies, word frequency"
Playfoot2013,"Age of acquisition (AoA) refers to the moment
in time in which words, objects, and faces are
first
learned. The common
finding is that objects,
faces, and words learned early in life are processed
more  quickly  than  those  learned  later  (e.g.,
Brysbaert & Ghyselinck, 2006; Izura et al., 2011;
Morrison & Ellis, 2000; Pérez, 2007; Richards &
Ellis, 2009). A current explanation for the AoA
effect is the arbitrary mappings hypothesis (Ellis
& Lambon Ralph, 2000). It states that the AoA
effect is a product of the connections created
during learning. When the relationship between
input and output is predictable, a late acquired
word can draw on existing knowledge to facilitate
processing. In regular words, for example, the
relationship of spelling to sound is consistent with
other similarly spelled words (e.g.,
sweet, feet ).
Thus, a newly learned word can map on to existing
representations (e.g., tweet). However, in irregular
words the pronunciation is less predictable and
the mapping is arbitrary (e.g., yacht). Under these
circumstances late acquired words do not benefit
from existing word knowledge and processing is
relatively slow.","age of acquisition, word association, word frequency, correlational studies, arbitrary mappings hypothesis"
Playfoot2013,"Word association responses have
also been shown to be affected by age of acquisition.
Van Loon-Vervoorn (1989, cited by Brysbaert

association task were recorded reliably faster (240
ms) when the cue was early-acquired. 
Brysbaert

words elicited association responses 279 ms faster
than late-acquired words. Further, Brysbaert et al.
(2000) provided evidence that there is greater
agreement among participants in the associations
generated  for  early-acquired  words.  Brysbaert

Rossiter2013,"Background: Previous research has highlighted psycholinguistic variables
influencing naming ability for individuals with aphasia, including:
familiarity, frequency, age of acquisition, imageability, operativity, and
length (Nickels & Howard, 1995) and a potential link between typicality and
generalisation to untreated items in intervention (Kiran, Sandberg, &
Sebastian, 2011). However, the effect of concept typicality (the extent to
which an item can be considered a prototype of a category) on naming in aphasia
warrants further examination.

Aims: To investigate first whether typicality can be reliably rated across a
range of natural semantic categories and second whether, and if so in which
direction, typicality influences naming performance for people with aphasia. To
provide quantitative and qualitative information on typicality for a set of
stimuli for use in future research.

Methods & Procedures: Typicality ratings were obtained and the results compared
with those in the existing literature. The influence of typicality on picture
naming was investigated employing both matched sets (high and low typicality
matched for other psycholinguistic variables) and logistic regression analyses
for the group and individual participants with aphasia (n = 20).

Outcomes & Results: Typicality rating correlated strongly with ratings obtained
in previous research (Rosch, 1975: r = .798, N = 35, p < .001; Uyeda & Mandler,
1980: r = .844, N = 47, p s< .001). Typicality was a significant predictor of
picture naming for the group and some individuals, with generally better
performance for typical items. This was demonstrated in both matched sets and
regression analyses. However, other psycholinguistic variables proved more
strongly related to naming success, particularly age of acquisition.

Conclusions: Typicality can be rated reliably and should be considered
alongside other psycholinguistic variables when investigating word retrieval
and intervention in aphasia. Further research is necessary to accurately model
the direction of typicality effects found in word retrieval. Finally, the
differing nature, size, and internal structure of categories require further
exploration when investigating typicality effects.

Meschyan2002,"The combined contributions of word age of acquisition (AoA) and word frequency (rated and objective) to word retrieval speed and accuracy were investigated, using a picture-naming paradigm. Results
from two fully factorial studies revealed that both AoA and word frequency reliably facilitate the speed
and accuracy of word retrieval. Furthermore, word frequency and AoA interacted across delay (0, 750,
1,500, and 2,250 msec) in Experiment 2. This resulted in word frequency’s playing a stronger role for late-
acquired words across delays. It is concluded that both AoA and word frequency play a fundamental
role in lexical retrieval. The results are also consistent with the view that both factors affect the same
processing stages.","age of acquisition, word frequency, correlational studies"

high for all categories tested, as were the correlations for prototypicality ratings between
the present study and that of Rosch (1975). In addition, correlations between prototypicality
ratings, production frequencies, and word frequencies of the items are given.","prototypicality, age of acquisition, word frequency, correlational studies"
Chiarello1999,"Dissociations between noun and verb processing are not uncommon after brain injury; yet, precise psycholinguistic comparisons of nouns and verbs are hampered by the underrepresentation of verbs in published semantic word norms and by the absence of contemporary estimates for part-of-speech usage. We report herein imageability ratings and rating response times (RTs) for 1,197 words previously categorized as pure nouns, pure verbs, or words of balanced noun-verb usage on the basis of the Francis and Kučera (1982) norms. Nouns and verbs differed in rated imageability, and there was a stronger correspondence between imageability rating and RT for nouns than for verbs. For all word types, the image-rating-RT function implied that subjects employed an image generation process to assign ratings. We also report a new measure of noun-verbtypicality that used the Hyperspace Analog to Language (HAL; Lund & Burgess, 1996) context vectors (derived from a large sample of Usenet text) to compute the mean context distance between each word and all of thepure nouns andpure verbs. For a subset of the items, the resulting HAL noun-verb difference score was compared with part-of-speech usage in a representative sample of the Usenet corpus. It is concluded that this score can be used to estimate the extent to which a given word occurs in typical noun or verb sentence contexts in informal contemporary English discourse. The item statistics given in Appendix B will enable experimenters to select representative examples of nouns and verbs or to compare typical with atypical nouns (or verbs), while holding constant or covarying rated imageability.","imageability, typicality, concept list"
Amancio2012,"In this paper we have quantified the consistency of word usage
in written texts represented by complex networks, where words were taken
as nodes, by measuring the degree of preservation of the node neighborhood.
Words were considered highly consistent if the authors used them with the same
neighborhood. When ranked according to the consistency of use, the words
obeyed a log-normal distribution, in contrast to Zipf’s law that applies to the
frequency of use. Consistency correlated positively with the familiarity and
frequency of use, and negatively with ambiguity and age of acquisition. An
inspection of some highly consistent words confirmed that they are used in very
limited semantic contexts. A comparison of consistency indices for eight authors
indicated that these indices may be employed for author recognition. Indeed, as
expected, authors of novels could be distinguished from those who wrote scientific
texts. Our analysis demonstrated the suitability of the consistency indices, which
can now be applied in other tasks, such as emotion recognition.","complex network, word association, word frequency"
Zevin2002,"Recent studies have suggested that age of acquisition (AoA) has an impact on skilled reading independent of factors such as frequency. This result raises questions about previous studies in which AoA was not controlled and about current theories in which it is not addressed. Analyses of the materials used in previous studies suggest that the observed AoA effects may have been due to other factors. We also found little evidence for an AoA effect in computational models of reading that used words that exhibit normal spelling-sound regularities. An AoA effect was observed, however, in a model in which early and late learned words did not overlap in terms of orthography or phonology. The results suggest that with other correlated properties of stimuli controled, AoA effects occur when what is learned about early patterns does not carry over to later ones. This condition is not characteristic of learning spelling-sound mappings but may be relevant to tasks such as learning the names for objects.","age of acquisition, correlational studies, word frequency, object naming"

subtitle frequencies are based on a corpus of 41M words taken from
contemporary movies and TV series (screened between 1990 and 2009). In
addition, the frequencies have been validated by correlating them with the
RTs from two megastudies involving 2,764 words each (lexical decision and

Haggarty2014,"Defining homologous genes is important in many evolutionary studies but raises obvious issues. Some of these issues are conceptual and stem from our assumptions of how a gene evolves, others are practical, and depend on the algorithmic decisions implemented in existing software. Therefore, to make progress in the study of homology, both ontological and epistemological questions must be considered. In particular, defining homologous genes cannot be solely addressed under the classic assumptions of strong tree thinking, according to which genes evolve in a strictly tree-like fashion of vertical descent and divergence and the problems of homology detection are primarily methodological. Gene homology could also be considered under a different perspective where genes evolve as ""public goods,"" subjected to various introgressive processes. In this latter case, defining homologous genes becomes a matter of designing models suited to the actual complexity of the data and how such complexity arises, rather than trying to fit genetic data to some a priori tree-like evolutionary model, a practice that inevitably results in the loss of much information. Here we show how important aspects of the problems raised by homology detection methods can be overcome when even more fundamental roots of these problems are addressed by analyzing public goods thinking evolutionary processes through which genes have frequently originated. This kind of thinking acknowledges distinct types of homologs, characterized by distinct patterns, in phylogenetic and nonphylogenetic unrooted or multirooted networks. In addition, we define ""family resemblances"" to include genes that are related through intermediate relatives, thereby placing notions of homology in the broader context of evolutionary relationships. We conclude by presenting some payoffs of adopting such a pluralistic account of homology and family relationship, which expands the scope of evolutionary analyses beyond the traditional, yet relatively narrow focus allowed by a strong tree-thinking view on gene evolution.","homology, partial homology, similarity, similarity networks, epistemology, ontology"

Decoene1993,"The basic speech unit (phoneme or syllable) problem was investigated with the primed matching task. In primed matching, subjects have to decide whether the elements of stimulus pairs
are the same or different. The prime should facilitate matching in as far as its representation
is similar to the stimuli to be matched. If stimulus representations generate graded structure,
with stimulus instances being more or less prototypical for the category, priming should interact
with prototypicality because prototypical instances are more similar to the activated category
than are low-prototypical instances. Rosch (1975a, 1975b) showed that, by varying the matching
criterion (matching for physical identity or for belonging to the same category), the specific patterns of the priming x prototypicality interaction could differentiate perceptually based from
abstract categories. By testing this pattern for phoneme and syllable categories, the abstraction
level of these categories can be studied. After finding reliable prototypicality effects for both phoneme and syllable categories (Experiments 1 and 2), primed phoneme matching (Experiments
3 and 4) and primed syllable matching (Experiments 5 and 6) were used under both physical identity instructions and same-category instructions. The results make clear that phoneme categories
are represented on the basis of perceptual information, whereas syllable representations are more
abstract. The phoneme category can thus be identified as the basic speech unit. Implications for
phoneme and syllable representation are discussed.","perception, speech unit, primed matching task, phoneme"
Decoene1993,"The impetus for the investigation of the speech unit hypothesis came from a simple experiment. Savin and Bever
(1970) had subjects monitor a sequence of meaningless
syllables for either a complete syllable or a phoneme (the
syllable-initial consonant or the medial vowel). Phoneme
monitoring was significantly slower than syllable monitoring. Savin and Bever concluded that phonemes are idenified after syllables of which they are parts, because
phonemes are not perceptual, but abstract, nonsensory
entities.","phoneme, perception, syllable, mental representation"
Decoene1993,"Mental categories can be placed on a continuum from
concrete to abstract, from entirely perceptually defined
to entirely conceptual (Medin & Barsalou, 1987; Rosch,
1975a, 1975b): The color blue is a perceptually based category, whereas the concept ""freedom"" has a purely abstract characterization.
[...]

In the primed matching task (Beller, 1971), subjects are
asked to decide as rapidly as possible whether or not elements of a stimulus pair are the same. The priming stimulus preceding the stimulus pair should facilitate the
matching process insofar as the mental category repre-
sentation it activates is similar to the stimuli to be matched.
If stimuli are instances of a category that generates a prototypicality effect, then the prime will activate a category
representation that is more similar to a good example than
to a bad example of the category. Thus, the prime will
facilitate judging similarity more in matching goodexample pairs than in matching poor-example pairs.
Primed matching will thus result in a priming X prototypi-
cality level interaction (henceforth, a P x P interaction).","primed matching task, perceptional category, abstract category"
Decoene1993,"In terms of the speech unit hypothesis, it can be concluded that phoneme categories are the basic units in
speech perception. They are more perceptually based -- hence, less abstract-than syllables.

Moreover, because
same-name pairs under same-name instructions showed
no significant P X P interaction, phoneme representations
seem to be entirely concrete. This in tum implies that phoneme categories form good patterns: The acoustic specification of a phonetic segment in the speech signal has
to be such that a mental representation can be constructed
from entirely perceptual characteristics. That is, the signal contains information allowing a stable perceptual description of phonetic segments by the perceptual system.","perceptional category, abstract category, phoneme, syllable"

Hartmann2014,"This paper aims at accounting for the emergence and loss of constraints governing the formation of
deverbal nominalizations in German from a cognitive point of view. Specifically, diachronic changes
in the formation of derivatives in the suffix -ung are investigated on the basis of two large corpora of
Middle High German (MHG, 1050-1350) and Early New High German (ENHG, 1350-1650) texts,
respectively. Employing the key notions of construal (e.g. Verhagen, 2007) and mental scanning (e.g.
Langacker, 1987) and adopting a usage-based perspective, this paper demonstrates that the
diachronic change of word formation patterns can be explained in terms of basic principles of
human cognition. It is shown that the emergence of word formation constraints affecting ung-nominalization can be attributed to an increase in (lexical-categorial) prototypicality: Numerous
frequent word formation products in -ung adopt features of more prototypical nouns by means of
lexicalization throughout the ENHG period. This change eventually affects the word formation
pattern itself, blocking the formation of more “verby”, i.e. processual, ung-nominals and rendering a
variety of previously felicitous derivatives ungrammatical. This development is paralleled by a loss

an exhaustive set of conditions on the output of the phonological rules - in fact,

'a theory of linguistic competence'

grammar is redundant it is the morphophonotactic rules, better known as morpheme structure conditions. 
I shall propose a format for the statement of rules
including so-called 'conspiracies') which are 'motivated' by the phonotactics in
the sense of Matthews (1972: 21~220). Finally, I shall present a set of phonotactic rules for consonant clusters in Latin, and show how the statement of
certain rules of Latin phonology can be simplified by taking their phonotactic

Since Stanley (1967), morpheme structure rules or conditions have played no role in the phonological interpretation of surface structures; if such rusles or conditions are to be justified at all, it must be for other reasons. I have argued elsewhere (Sommersten, 1973) that the justification for tactic rules of some kind in phonology is that native speakers can tell the difference between forms that on the evidence of their phonological shape 'belong' in their languages (even though the forms may not actually appear in the lexicon) and forms that do not; in the time-honoured illustration, between *blick and *bnick.

Meheust2016,"The integration of foreign genetic information is central to the
evolution of eukaryotes, as has been demonstrated for the origin
of the Calvin cycle and of the heme and carotenoid biosynthesis
pathways in algae and plants. For photosynthetic lineages, this
coordination involved three genomes of divergent phylogenetic
origins (the nucleus, plastid, and mitochondrion). Major hurdles
overcome by the ancestor of these lineages were harnessing the
oxygen evolving organelle, optimizing the use of light, and stabilizing the partnership between the plastid endosymbiont and host
through retargeting of proteins to the nascent organelle. Here we
used protein similarity networks that can disentangle reticulate
gene histories to explore how these significant challenges were
met. We discovered a previously hidden component of algal and
plant nuclear genomes that originated from the plastid endosymbiont: symbiogenetic genes (S-genes). These composite proteins,
exclusive to photosynthetic eukaryotes, encode a cyanobacteriumderived domain fused to one of cyanobacterial or another prokary-
otic origin and have emerged multiple, independent times during
evolution. Transcriptome data demonstrate the existence and expression of S-genes across a wide swath of algae and plants and
functional data indicate their involvement in tolerance to oxidative stress, phototropism, and adaptation to nitrogen-limitation.
Our research demonstrates the “recycling” of genetic information
by photosynthetic eukaryotes to generate novel composite genes,

Gligorijevic2016,"**Motivation:** Discovering patterns in networks of protein–protein interactions (PPIs) is a central
problem in systems biology. Alignments between these networks aid functional understanding as
they uncover important information, such as evolutionary conserved pathways, protein complexes
and functional orthologs. However, the complexity of the multiple network alignment problem
grows exponentially with the number of networks being aligned and designing a multiple network
aligner that is both scalable and that produces biologically relevant alignments is a challenging
task that has not been fully addressed. The objective of multiple network alignment is to create
clusters of nodes that are evolutionarily and functionally conserved across all networks.
Unfortunately, the alignment methods proposed thus far do not meet this objective as they are
guided by pairwise scores that do not utilize the entire functional and evolutionary information
across all networks.

**Results:** To overcome this weakness, we propose Fuse, a new multiple network alignment algo-
rithm that works in two steps. First, it computes our novel protein functional similarity scores by
fusing information from wiring patterns of all aligned PPI networks and sequence similarities
between their proteins. This is in contrast with the previous tools that are all based on protein simi-
larities in pairs of networks being aligned. Our comprehensive new protein similarity scores are
computed by Non-negative Matrix Tri-Factorization (NMTF) method that predicts associations be-
tween proteins whose homology (from sequences) and functioning similarity (from wiring pat-
terns) are supported by all networks. Using the five largest and most complete PPI networks from
BioGRID, we show that NMTF predicts a large number protein pairs that are biologically consistent.
Second, to identify clusters of aligned proteins over all networks, Fuse uses our novel maximum
weight k-partite matching approximation algorithm. We compare Fuse with the state of the art mul-
tiple network aligners and show that (i) by using only sequence alignment scores, Fuse already
outperforms other aligners and produces a larger number of biologically consistent clusters that
cover all aligned PPI networks and (ii) using both sequence alignments and topological NMTF-
predicted scores leads to the best multiple network alignments thus far.","multiple network alignment, alignment, data fusion, software"

This language, which was called Guānghuà 官話 [""language of the officials or mandarins""] was described in detail by European Catholic priests, who intended to use it in their missionary activities in the Chinese empire. The Guānhuà treated n these missionary sources, and denoted there as *la lengua (~ lingua) mandarina* [""the mandarin language""] , was clearly identified by the missionaries as a Nanking-based koine. It was, in fact, essentially the same Jiānghuái 江淮 -type koine which had been used throughout the preceding Míng dynasty.

in the philological work of earlier scholars such as Bernhard Karlgren and his epigones.
Indeed, it was only in the final decades of the last century that enough detailed data on the
group became available to support meaningful comparative research. Three book-length
works of great importance that appeared in the 1990’s were the Kè-Gàn fāngyán diàochá

the Gàn family. Since the advent the new century, many more articles and several book-length
works have appeared, dealing both with individual Gàn varieties and with entire groups of these
dialects. Indeed, our ever-growing corpus of Gàn material is now quite impressive. However,
to the best of our knowledge, as of this writing no comparative phonological reconstruction
covering the entire family has appeared in print. It is accordingly the primary goal of the
present work to remedy this deficiency. To wit, we propose to reconstruct a Common Gàn
phonological system and then to demonstrate how this reconstruction can be used as a tool for
the study of lexical, taxonomic, and historical problems in comparative Gàn.
 
In order to undertake a comparative reconstruction, one must begin by deciding what to
compare. In the case of Gàn, this proves to be a complex issue, for no cogent classificatory
scheme for the family has so far been proposed. Indeed, the late Professor Jerry Norman once
remarked that it is easier to say what Gàn is not than to say what it is. In confronting this
conundrum, our initial approach will be to use in our comparative work only dialects that are
universally recognized as Gàn, and to set aside for the nonce any whose assignment to the group
is problematic or disputed. Then, once our common phonological system has been reconstructed,
we shall return to the problem of taxonomy and, by comparing our new common system with
others posited for contiguous dialect families, we shall attempt a delineation of the Gàn family
as a whole. Finally, when these tasks have been completed, we shall be in a position to
propound a set of guidelines for testing the affiliations of those dialects whose taxonomy is
currently in question.

Coupe2016,"In their paper, Everett et al. (2016) stress how a shift
could or should take place from autonomous linguistic
forms to ecologically adaptive ones. This raises the issue
of the meaning of ecology when it comes to languages,
and to what the Greek root of this word—oikos, the
house or the habitat—actually refers.

Several authors have equated the ecology of languages
with their social environment, i.e., communities of speak-
ers. When describing the ecology of language evolution,
Mufwene (2001) exemplified how situations of contact
between several languages in colonial plantations resulted
in specific selections and assemblages of linguistic forms.
More recently, Lupyan and Dale’s (2010) ecolinguistic
niche hypothesis points at how differing social contexts
may shape language structures, much as ecological niches
shape organisms. They suggest in particular that a high
percentage of adult L2 learners in a linguistic community
may push toward less morphological complexity.
Another example of social influences on linguistic forms
is the debated positive correlation between the number of
speakers of a language and the size of its phonological in-
ventory (Hay and Bauer 2007; Bybee 2011).

The notion of ecology can also relate to the natural
environment in which speakers live and interact, as it is
the case in Everett et al.’s contribution. Different phe-
nomena can be acknowledged, which may take place
simultaneously or not in specific situations.

Donohue2016,"Does (the presence or complexity of) tone inversely correlate with dryness of climate? The authors (Everett
et al.) suggest that the absence of ambient humidity in
the air negatively correlates with the presence of (complex?) lexical tone, partly because of the effect that dry
air has to increase the difficulty in achieving precise
articulatory targets.

There are two main problems with the argumentation used.


1. Conflating ‘tone’ with ‘pitch’ or ‘fundamental frequency’, and mistaking ‘complexity’ with a syllable domain for tone assignment;

2. conflating ‘dry climate’ with the absence of humidity.

The authors are not guilty in an absolute sense of these
problems, acknowledging that there are complications.

Their reliance on pitch contrasts as a proxy for tonal category contrasts, and the use of air humidity rather than
(easily available) climate information for the ranges of
different languages means that the authors are dealing
with ephemeral correlations between proxy features.

tone primarily to refer to distinctions realised by pitch,

the existence of tone categories.","tone language, correlational studies, tone change, climate"
Ember2016,"The Everett et al. (2016) article makes a strong and compelling case that some, if not many, aspects of language
may be ecological adaptations to climate. Their argument is not just theoretical, but it is supported by many
strands of evidence including careful and systematic
worldwide cross-cultural research. The purpose of the
present comment is not to detract from the ecological argument, but rather to suggest that linguists would do
well to also consider some psychological mechanisms to
explain language differences and similarities.

The ‘personality integration of culture’ model first put
forward by John W. M. Whiting and Irvin L. Child (1953)
and elaborated further in subsequent years (Whiting and
Whiting 1978: 44–45) has inspired many cross-cultural
studies. It proposes that some aspects of culture (referred
to as ‘maintenance systems’) respond directly to climate
and ecological conditions. Maintenance systems include
culture traits such as subsistence patterns, means of production, settlement patterns, family structure, and political
and social structures. But there are other aspects of culture
referred to as ‘projective or expressive systems’ (such as religion, rituals, folklore, games, and art, and crime rates)
that are probably not adaptive and might best be ex-
plained by psychological mechanisms such as generalization, projection, defense mechanisms, or identification.
The model is referred to as ‘personality integration of culture’ because it is believed that the maintenance systems
predict the expressive systems via differences in childrearing and resulting differences in modal personality.
Although Whiting and Child did not specifically discuss
language as part of a culture’s expressive system, in my
earlier work with Melvin Ember on language, two expectations about linguistic variation were derived from psychological theorizing about music. Both had empirical
support in our worldwide cross-cultural tests.","tone language, linguistic complexity, correlational studies"
Hammarstroem2016a,"Everett, Blasi, and Roberts in their position paper

work ‘supports’ the idea that ambient desiccation in the
area where a language is spoken leads to the absence of
lexical tone (EBRPP: 1).

[...]

The case, then, boils down to the authors’ second
point, i.e. the empirical validity of the idea of ecological
adaptivity of human language. The authors cite a number of studies which ‘suggest’ this is the case but without
even a modicum of critical scrutiny of these studies
(EBRPP: 3–4). Beyond ‘suggestive’ studies, the full
weight of the case is rested on the authors’ own recent

which have not been noted before to the exploration of the essential distinction between Mental
Ability and Physical Ability. Our interest in this topic is intrigued by three interesting issues
concerning the Mental Ability modal verb hui 會 in Standard Mandarin and its cognate or corre-
sponding morphemes in Chinese dialects (hui hereafter). The hui-type modals in Chinese dialects
have three properties, i.e. their modal functions cover a range from possibility to necessity; the
‘ability’ use is strictly restricted to Mental/Intellectual Ability; and its epistemic use has a strong
tendency to have a future-time reference. In addition, its semantic change process has been a
controversial issue so far. With the ‘Semantic Map Model’, a new typological tool, we reconstruct
hui’s semantic development path by cross-linguistic comparison, the core of which is ‘mental
ability ĺ objective necessity ĺ epistemic probability’. It is proved that this reconstruction has
its advantages over other proposals in more adequate explanation of the semantic properties of
the hui-type modals in Chinese dialects, and it is fully in line with relevant universals in cross-
linguistic semantic-connection. It demonstrates that adopting typological approaches to the studies
of specific languages can benefit not only the research on linguistic particulars, but also language
universals.","Chinese dialects, linguistic reconstruction,"

Hill2015,"We present SimLex-999, a gold standard resource for evaluating distributional semantic mod-

association or relatedness so that pairs of entities that are associated but not actually similar
(Freud, psychology) have a low rating. We show that, via this focus on similarity, SimLex-999
incentivizes the development of models with a different, and arguably wider, range of applications
than those which reflect conceptual association. Second, SimLex-999 contains a range of concrete
and abstract adjective, noun, and verb pairs, together with an independent rating of concreteness
and (free) association strength for each pair. This diversity enables fine-grained analyses of the
performance of models on concepts of different types, and consequently greater insight into how
architectures can be improved. Further, unlike existing gold standard evaluations, for which
automatic approaches have reached or surpassed the inter-annotator agreement ceiling, state-of-
the-art models perform well below this ceiling on SimLex-999. There is therefore plenty of scope
for SimLex-999 to quantify future improvements to distributional semantic models, guiding the
development of the next generation of representation-learning architectures.","speech norms, semantic similarity, word association, word association data"

Language Contact, another area of Rob’s deep interest, commences with
a paper by Monali Longmailai, a Dimasa native speaker, whose work compares
phonological, morphological and lexical similarities between unrelated lan-
guages Dimasa and Khasi that have been in close contact for many years. A
paper from U. V. Joseph and Linda Konnerth carefully considers borrowings
from Indic languages into Tiwa, giving evidence for borrowings that may have
occurred at different times in the history of the Indic languages and suggesting
the importance of understanding the place of Khasi as a contact language as
well. Toni Huber makes a thorough study of a word for ‘ancestral deity’, per-
haps derived from a form se, using as its basis examples of the word as found in
old literary as well as modern spoken sources, and grounding his study in a
wealth of ethnographic information.

Historical Phonology is yet another of Rob’s specialties, and in this sec-
tion Mark W. Post gives a fieldworker’s guide to one of the thorniest problems
for the description of languages of this area – tone. The paper focusses on the
Tani subgroup of Tibeto-Burman, giving both the new fieldworker and the sea-
soned language researcher clear suggestions on both theory and methodology.
Martine Mazaudon gives an account of an uncommon feature in Tibeto-Burman
languages: vowel length contrasts on open syllables. She shows how those dis-
tinctions have been retained, or merged, in a variety of Tamangic languages,
relating this to similar processes in the languages of Europe. Sarah Thomason
presents a detailed analysis of sound changes involving velars in Montana Sa-
lish, a language of North America, giving readers a considered account of a
very common occurrence in comparative linguistics: irregularities that can’t
easily be explained.

Our final section, Language in Culture goes to the heart of yet another
key area of Rob’s work. Yankee Modi, a native speaker of several languages of
Arunachal Pradesh, writes about the importance of social organization to lan-
guage distributions and language change in the Tani area. Tanka Subba’s
chapter considers a number of major issues affecting the tribes of the Northeast
Indian region today in relation to the wording of the Indian Government policy
documents that affect them. Gwendolyn Hyslop’s chapter takes a detailed look
at terms for grains and dairy and suggests that only some can be reconstructed
for Proto East Bodish in Bhutan, specifically the dairy terms and buckwheat and
barley. This suggests that before the breakup of the East Bodish, these were the
items farmed. Shobhana Chelliah presents a complete narrative in Meitei – a
story grounded in agricultural practices – but the focus of the paper is on the
rhetorical structures of the story telling and why the study of these is so essen-
tial for language documentation. George van Driem’s wide-ranging paper places
language in a broader context, as part of human evolution. Citing biologists,
anthropologists and other scientists as well as linguists and authors of literary
note, the paper treats language as life form, constantly growing and changing.
To round off the volume, Roger Blench presents a brief overview of the litera-
ture from the emerging field of ophresiology, the study of taste and smell,
exemplifying it using the wide range of specialised taste terms in the Kman lan-
guage of Arunachal Pradesh (also known as Miju or Miju Mishmi).

McRae2005,"Semantic features have provided insight into numerous behavioral phenomena concerning concepts, categorization, and semantic memory in adults, children, and neuropsychological populations. Numerous theories and models in these areas are based on representations and computations involving semantic features. Consequently, empirically derived semantic feature production norms have played, and continue to play, a highly useful role in these domains. This article describes a set of feature norms collected from approximately 725 participants for 541 living (dog) and nonliving (chair) basic-level concepts, the largest such set of norms developed to date. This article describes the norms and numerous statistics associated with them. Our aim is to make these norms available to facilitate other research, while obviating the need to repeat the labor-intensive methods involved in collecting and analyzing such norms.

Alonso2005,"Subjective estimations of age of acquisition (AoA) for a large pool of Spanish words were collected from college students in Spain.

Beyond its intrinsic value as a standalone corpus, the largest of its kind for Spanish, the value of the database is enhanced by the fact that it contains most of the words that are currently included in other normative studies, allowing for a more complete characterization of the lexical stimuli that are usually employed in studies with Spanish-speaking participants.

Sze2014,"The Chinese language has more native speakers than any other language, but research on the reading of Chinese characters is still not as well-developed as it is for the reading of words in alphabetic languages. Two areas notably lacking are the paucity of megastudies in Chinese and the relatively infrequent use of the lexical decision paradigm to investigate single-character recognition. The Chinese Lexicon Project, described in this article, is a database of lexical decision latencies for 2,500 Chinese single characters in simplified script, collected from a sample of native mainland Chinese (Mandarin) speakers (N = 35). This resource will provide a valuable adjunct to influential mega-databases, such as the English, French, and Dutch Lexicon Projects. Using two separate analyses, some advantages associated with megastudies are exemplified. These include the selection of the strongest measure to represent Chinese character frequency (Cai & Brysbaert's (PLoS ONE 5(6): e10729, 2010) subtitle contextual diversity frequency count), and the conducting of virtual studies to replicate and clarify existing findings. The unique morpho-syllabic nature of the Chinese writing system makes it a valuable case study for functional language contrasts. Moreover, this is the first publicly available large-scale repository of behavioral responses pertaining to Chinese language processing (the behavioral dataset is attached to this article, as a supplemental file available for download). For these reasons, the data should be of substantial interest to psychologists, linguists, and other researchers.","speech norms, Chinese, lexical database, dataset"
Medler2005,"Concepts vary markedly in the degree to which they make reference to different domains of sensory-motor experience. For example, the concept thunder is defined primarily in terms of its sound, and since it has no visual representation and cannot be touched or manipulated, makes no reference to color, shape, motion, tactile, or kinesthetic attributes. In contrast, the concept tomato includes salient color and shape attributes, but no sound or motion characteristics.

This page contains mean perceptual attribute ratings in 4 sensory-motor domains (Sound, Color, Manipulation, Motion) for 1402 words, as well as Emotion ratings reflecting intensity and valence of emotional associations for the same words.

These norms were collected from 342 undergraduate students, using an online form. For the sensory-motor domains (Sound, Color, Motion, and Manipulation), each participant was presented with a subset of the words and asked to rate how important a particular attibute domain was to the meaning of each word on a scale from 0 (not at all important) to 6 (very important). Each participant rated the words on only a single sensory-motor domain. For the Emotion ratings, paricipants were asked to rate how negative or positive were the emotions they associated with each word, using a scale from -6 (very negative feeling) to +6 (very positive feeling), with 0 being a neutral feeling.

Factor analysis of 32 properties identified 9 orthogonal factors and demonstrated both the redundancy among various measures and the tendency for some attributes (e.g., age of acquisition) to load on multiple factors. The second extension collected basic ratings of imagery, familiarity, and a new age of acquisition measure for a larger pool of 2,311 words, including parts of speech other than nouns. The analysis of these ratings and supplementary statistics computed for the words (e.g., number of syllables, Kucera-Francis frequency) demonstrated again the relative independence of various measures and the importance of obtaining diverse properties for such norms.

Bird2001,"Age of acquisition and imageability ratings were collected for 2,645 words, including 892 verbs and 213 function words. Words that were ambiguous as to grammatical category were disambiguated: Verbs were shown in their infinitival form, and nouns (where appropriate) were preceded by the indefinite article (such as to crack and a crack). Subjects were speakers of British English selected from a wide age range, so that differences in the responses across age groups could be compared. Within the subset of early acquired noun/verb homonyms, the verb forms were rated as later acquired than the nouns, and the verb homonyms of high-imageability nouns were rated as significantly less imageable than their noun counterparts. A small number of words received significantly earlier or later age of acquisition ratings when the 20-40 years and 50-80 years age groups were compared. These tend to comprise words that have come to be used more frequently in recent years (either through technological advances or social change), or those that have fallen out of common usage. Regression analyses showed that although word length, familiarity, and concreteness make independent contributions to the age of acquisition measure, frequency and imageability are the most important predictors of rated age of acquisition.","speech norms, age of acquisition, imagability, English"

Keuleers2011,"Polysemy The final topic we will address is the effect of
polysemy—that is, the existence of different meanings for
the same word. As can be seen from Table 14, word
recognition research has suggested a small facilitation effect
of number of meanings. Although there is a similar
tendency in the BLP, none of the effects reached significance in the virtual experiments.

Rodd, Gaskell, and Marslen-Wilson (2000) criticized the
existing research on polysemy in word recognition because
it failed to make a distinction between words with multiple
related senses (e.g., the adjective uniform [similar in form]
and the noun uniform [clothing worn by a particular group])
and words with multiple unrelated meanings (e.g., bank
[financial institution] and bank [land alongside a river]).
Rodd et al.’s results suggested that the effect of polysemy
was limited to words with true polysemy (multiple related
senses). As Table 15 shows, the same tendency is found in
the BLP data, but the effects are again smaller than in the
original experiment. In addition, the BLP data suggest that
both number of meanings and number of senses impact
word recognition.","polysemy, speech norms, lexical decision task, word processing"
Rodd2000,"There have been several reports in the literature of faster visual lexical decisions to words that are semantically ambiguous. All current models of this ambiguity advantage assume that it is the presence of multiple unrelated meanings that produce this benefit. A set of three lexical decision experiments reported here challenge this assumption. We contrast the ambiguity seen in words like bark, which have multiple unrelated meanings, with words that have multiple related word senses (e.g., twist). In all three experiments we find that while multiple word senses do produce faster responses, ambiguity between multiple meanings delays recognition. These results suggest that, while competition between the multiple meanings of ambiguous words delays their recognition, the rich semantic representations associated with words with many senses facilitate their recognition.","semantic similarity, ambiguity, polysemy, homophony"
Rodd2000,"As mentioned earlier, lexicographers routinely distinguish between word meanings and
word senses when they structure dictionary entries. These dictionary entries provide a simple,
yet reliable way to classify words as being ambiguous between multiple meanings or between
multiple senses. We have used the entries in The
Online Wordsmyth English Dictionary–Thesaurus (Parks, Ray, & Bland, 1998). 1 As we report later, the classifications made in this dictionary correspond closely to participants’
judgements about the relatedness of the meanings of ambiguous words.

Millis and Button (1989) use tell as an example of a word that has many meanings. Participants produced up to four meanings for this
word. These were to inform, to explain, to understand, and to relate in detail. Although there
are clearly important differences between these
four definitions, these differences are relatively
subtle; all four definitions relate to a single core
meaning of the word, to do with providing information. All these definitions are included as
senses within a single entry in the Wordsmyth
dictionary. This is just one of several examples
of high-ambiguity items that are ambiguous between multiple word senses rather than between
unrelated word meanings.","polysemy, homophony, meaning, sense,"
Rodd2000,"Many words are semantically ambiguous, and
can refer to more than one concept. For example, bark can refer either to a part of a tree or to
the sound made by a dog. To understand such
words, we must select one of these different interpretations, normally on the basis of the context in which the word occurs.


Words can be ambiguous in different ways; a
word like bark has two semantically unrelated
meanings, which seem to share the same written
and spoken form purely by chance. More common than this type of accidental ambiguity is the
systematic ambiguity between related word
senses. For example, the word *twist*  has a range
of dictionary definitions including 
*to make into a coil or spiral, to operate by turning, to alter
the shape of, to misconstrue the meaning of, to
wrench or sprain, and to squirm or writhe*. 

The
meaning of this word varies systematically according to the context in which the word is used;
for example, there are important differences between what it means to twist an ankle compared
with to twist the truth. However, although the
meaning of the word is ambiguous between
these different interpretations, the interpretations are closely related to each other both etymologically and semantically; this is quite unlike the ambiguity for a word like bark.","polysemy, colexification, homophony"
Rodd2000,"Homonyms, such as the two
meanings of bark, are considered to be different
words that, by chance, share the same orthographic and phonological form. Specifically, homographs are different words that share the same
orthographic form, while homophones share the
same phonological form. 
On the other hand, [pb] a polysemous word like twist is considered to be a
single word that has more than one sense. Despite
this linguistic distinction between homonymy and
polysemy, psychologists have often used the two
terms interchangeably (see Klein and Murphy
(2001) for a discussion of this issue).","polysemy, homophony, definition"
Rodd2000,"The ambiguity advantage is the finding that
visual lexical decisions are faster for words that
are semantically ambiguous. Early reports of an
ambiguity advantage came from Rubenstein,
Garfield, Millikan (1970) and Jastrzembski
(1981), who found faster visual lexical decisions for ambiguous words than for unambiguous words matched for overall frequency. However, Gernsbacher (1984) discussed a possible
confound between ambiguity and familiarity in
these experiments; words with more than one
meaning are typically more familiar. She found
no effect of ambiguity over and above familiar-
ity.","familiarity, ambiguity, correlational studies"
Rodd2000,"In summary, all current accounts of the ambiguity advantage assume that it is ambiguity between unrelated meanings that produces the ambiguity advantage. None of these models
explicitly predict what the effect of multiple
word senses should be. For those models in
which the benefit arises because of the presence
of multiple localist lexical entries for ambiguous
words, the presence of a benefit for words with
multiple senses will depend on whether multiple
senses are represented as separate entries within
the network. Those models that involve distributed semantic representations predict that words
with multiple senses may show a processing advantage, but that this should be reduced compared with words with multiple meanings.","ambiguity, ambiguity advantage, lexical decision task, polysemy"

how the sounds are articulated in each language in the positions for which the
set is valid; that is, we made an allophonic transcription. We then processed each
set of correspondences by comparing the phonetic value for each language in the
set with the phonetic value for every other language. For the 7 languages, we
made 21 pairwise comparisons for each set of correspondences. (Out of curiosity,
we further included a conjectured pronunciation for Classical Latin in each set
of correspondences, making 28 pairwise comparisons for each set.) In comparing
two sounds, we first decided whether they were perceptually the same or perceptually different. Where they differed, the next step was to determine how much
they differed.","Romance, data preparation, dataset, phonetic transcription, sound correspondences, phonetic similarity"

Rodd2000,"The findings show a fundamental difference between polysemous words and homophonous words. Polysemous words are apparently more easy to understand for the speakers, so they have an advantage of being processed and serve apparently a fundamental function in guaranteein effective communication. Homophonies, that is, really ambiguous words, on the other hand, are not helping communications.

Note that these findings support findings on cross-linguistic polysemies, namely, that the meanings with higher polysemy degree are earlier learned by children, and that they are more frequent in communication. This agains shows that a tendency towards polysemy seems to reflect a potentially important communicative function.

Alternatively, however, it could just reflect the fact that words which are acquired earlier are more likely to become polysemous, since the longer words are in a language, or in the language of a speaker, the more chance they have to acquire more meanings. Think of Starostin's 1989 idea of ""aging words"" in this context. No matter how we turn it: the whole complex of polysemy, age of acquisition, frequency, and stability is highly interesting in the context of semantic change and cognition, and this paper discusses many important points from a psycholinguistic perspective which should be dealt more clearly with in historical linguistics.","polysemy, age of acquisition, frequency, homophony, colexification, ambiguity"

Phyletic characters are similar to cognates, since they are changes which, in principle, can recur independently, but which are sufficiently specific to be recognized as unique in a particular family.

‘foot+print’, ‘joy+ful+ness’, ‘play+er+s’. However, it is
not uncommon that the form does consist of several morphemes, which are the smallest elements of syntax, but

‘joystick’ is composed of ‘joy’ and ‘stick’. Perturbation
means that changes are introduced that give the whole
a unique identity, e.g., the meaning of ‘joystick’ is not
exactly the result of the composition of the parts. This
framework is similar to the class hierarchy of many programming languages, where classes can modify default

concise, and moreover gives a concise representation for
the corpus.","Morfessor, morpheme detection, unsupervised method"
Creutz2005,"A consequence of this kind of approach is that frequent word forms remain unsplit, whereas rare word forms

‘s+ed+it+ious’, ‘vol+can+o’). There is no proper notion
of compositionality in the model, because frequent strings
are usually kept together whereas rare strings are split. In

Evans2014,"In this paper, I lay out the workings of the rather unusual system of positional
verbs found in Nen, a language of the Morehead-Maro family in Morehead district, Western Province, Papua New Guinea. Nen is unusual in its lexicalization
patterns: it has very few verbs that are intransitive, with most verbs that tend to
be intransitive cross-linguistically realized as morphologically middle verbs,
including ‘talk’, ‘work’, ‘descend’, and so on. Within the fifty attested morphologically intransitive verbs, forty-five comprise an interesting class of “positional
verbs,” the subject of this paper; the others are ‘be’, its derivatives ‘come’ and
‘go’ (lit. ‘be hither’ and ‘be thither’), and ‘walk’. Positional verbs denote spatial
positions and postures like ‘be sitting’, ‘be up high’, ‘be erected (of a building)’,
‘be open’, ‘be in a tree-fork’, ‘be at the end of something’.

Positional verbs differ from regular verbs in lacking in¿nitives, in possessing
a special “stative” aspect inÀection and an unusual system for building a fourway number system (building large plurals by combining singular and dual
markers), and in participating in a productive three-way alternation between
positional statives (like ‘be high’), placement transitives (like ‘put up high’), and
get-into-position middles (like ‘get into a high position’). The latter two types are
more like normal verbs (for example, they possess in¿nitives and participate in
the normal TAM series), but they are formally derived from the positionals.
The paper concludes by situating the Nen system regionally and typologi-
cally. Similar systems are found in related languages, but with the exception of
the Eastern Torres Strait language Meriam Mer, no comparable system has
been reported anywhere in New Guinea—the “classi¿catory verbs” known
from languages like Ku Waru are quite different, serving primarily to classify
objects rather than to give spatial dispositions. On the other hand, rather similar systems are found in some parts of Meso-America and the Amazon.","positional verbs, semantics, denotation"

Miele2012,"**Motivation**

Proteins can be naturally classified into families of
homologous sequences that derive from a common ancestor. The
comparison of homologous sequences and the analysis of their
phylogenetic relationships provide useful information regarding the
function and evolution of genes. One important difficulty of clustering
methods is to distinguish highly divergent homologous sequences
from sequences that only share partial homology due to evolution by
protein domain rearrangements. Existing clustering methods require
parameters that have to be set a priori. Given the variability in
the evolution pattern among proteins, these parameters cannot be
optimal for all gene families

**Results**

We propose a strategy that aims at clustering sequences
homologous over their entire length, and that takes into account the
pattern of substitution specific to each gene family. Sequences are
first all compared with each other and clustered into pre-families,
based on pairwise similarity criteria, with permissive parameters to
optimize sensitivity. Pre-families are then divided into homogeneous
clusters, based on the topology of the similarity network. Finally,
clusters are progressively merged into families, for which we compute
multiple alignments, and we use a model selection technique to
find the optimal tradeoff between the number of families and
multiple alignment likelihood. To evaluate this method, called
HiFiX,
we analyzed simulated sequences and manually curated datasets.
These tests showed that
HiFiX
is the only method robust to both
sequence divergence and domain rearrangements.

enough to be used on very large datasets.","clustering, network clustering, partitioning, homolog detection, Python"

Roettger2013,"**Motivation:** Homology detection is a long-standing challenge in computational biology. To tackle this problem, typically all-versus-all BLAST results are coupled with data partitioning approaches resulting in clusters of putative homologous proteins. One of the main problems, however, has been widely neglected: all clustering tools need a density parameter that adjusts the number and size of the clusters. This parameter is crucial but hard to estimate without gold standard data at hand. Developing a gold standard, however, is a difficult and time consuming task. Having a reliable method for detecting clusters of homologous proteins between a huge set of species would open opportunities for better understanding the genetic repertoire of bacteria with different lifestyles.

**Results:** Our main contribution is a method for identifying a suitable and robust density parameter for protein homology detection without a given gold standard. Therefore, we study the core genome of 89 actinobacteria. This allows us to incorporate background knowledge, i.e. the assumption that a set of evolutionarily closely related species should share a comparably high number of evolutionarily conserved proteins (emerging from phylum-specific housekeeping genes). We apply our strategy to find genes/proteins that are specific for certain actinobacterial lifestyles, i.e. different types of pathogenicity. The whole study was performed with transitivity clustering, as it only requires a single intuitive density parameter and has been shown to be well applicable for the task of protein sequence clustering. Note, however, that the presented strategy generally does not depend on our clustering method but can easily be adapted to other clustering approaches. ","automatic threshold selection, density parameter, transitivity clustering, network partitioning, partitioning"
Roettger2013,"This approach is rather simple, although not necessarily easiy to adapt.

Then they use the harmonic mean to optimize this function.

Basically, the idea might be followed up on a small scale, since it does not really seem to be impossible to re-implement something similar in a brute-force search. However, the authors still require a threshold, which means that the problem of threshold detection cannot be completely avoided for the moment.","transitivity clustering, network partitioning, Java, Cytoscape, homolog detection"

**Background**

An important problem in computational biology is the automatic detection of protein families (groups of homologous sequences). Clustering sequences into families is at the heart of most comparative studies dealing with protein evolution, structure, and function. Many methods have been developed for this task, and they perform reasonably well (over 0.88 of F-measure) when grouping proteins with high sequence identity. However, for highly diverged proteins the performance of these methods can be much lower, mainly because a common evolutionary origin is not deduced directly from sequence similarity. To the best of our knowledge, a systematic evaluation of clustering methods over distant homologous proteins is still lacking.

**Results**

We performed a comparative assessment of four clustering algorithms: Markov Clustering (MCL), Transitive Clustering (TransClust), Spectral Clustering of Protein Sequences (SCPS), and High-Fidelity clustering of protein sequences (HiFix), considering several datasets with different levels of sequence similarity. Two types of similarity measures, required by the clustering sequence methods, were used to evaluate the performance of the algorithms: the standard measure obtained from sequence–sequence comparisons, and a novel measure based on profile-profile comparisons, used here for the first time.

**Conclusions**

The results reveal low clustering performance for the highly divergent datasets when the standard measure was used. However, the novel measure based on profile-profile comparisons substantially improved the performance of the four methods, especially when very low sequence identity datasets were evaluated. We also performed a parameter optimization step to determine the best configuration for each clustering method. We found that TransClust clearly outperformed the other methods for most datasets. This work also provides guidelines for the practical application of clustering sequence methods aimed at detecting accurately groups of related protein sequences.

Dellert2016,"We propose a new method for empirically determining lists of basic concepts for the purpose of compiling
extensive lexicostatistical databases. The idea is to approximate
a notion of “swadeshness” formally and reproducibly without
expert knowledge or bias, and being able to rank any number
of concepts given enough data. Unlike previous approaches, our
procedure indirectly measures both stability of concepts against
lexical replacement, and their proneness to phenomena such as
onomatopoesia and extensive borrowing. The method provides a
fully automated way to generate customized Swadesh lists of any
desired length, possibly adapted to a given geographical region.
We apply the method to a large lexical database of Northern
Eurasia, deriving a swadeshness ranking for more than 5,000
concepts expressed by German lemmas. We evaluate this ranking
against existing shorter lists of basic concepts to validate the
method, and give an English version of the 300 top concepts

Dawyndt2006,"A new algorithm is proposed for generating min-transitive approximations of a given similarity matrix (i.e. a symmetric matrix with elements in the unit interval and diagonal elements equal to one). Different approximations are generated depending on the choice of an aggregation operator that plays a central role in the algorithm. If the maximum operator is chosen, then the approximation coincides with the min-transitive closure of the given similarity matrix. In case of the arithmetic mean, a transitive approximation is generated which is, on the average, as close to the given similarity matrix as the approximation generated by the UPGMA hierarchical clustering algorithm. The new algorithm also allows to generate approximations in a purely ordinal setting. As this new approach is weight-driven, the partition tree associated to the corresponding min-transitive approximation can be built layer by layer. Numerical tests carried out on synthetic data are used for comparing different approximations generated by the new algorithm with certain approximations obtained by classical methods.","clustering, UPGMA, transitivity, network partitioning"
Dawyndt2006,"Algorithm TCGA essentially consists of an outer repeat loop running over all edges of
the weighted graph, and for each of these edges an inner for loop running over all nodes
of the graph. All triangular subgraphs visited in this way are made locally transitive by
raising, if necessary, the smallest weight in the triangular subgraph. The algorithm is called
weight-driven because the order in which in the outer loop edges are visited is not arbi-
trary, but proceeds in descending order of the edge weights.

Proceeding along the same line of thoughts, however not persisting on restoring locally
the transitivity by raising the smallest edge weight—a fortiori leading to a matrix that
includes the input matrix—the transitivity of triangular subgraphs is imposed by lowering
the middle and increasing the lowest weight so that they both become equal. More [pb]
precisely, the two weights are aggregated into a single weight by means of a symmetric
aggregation operator denoted furtheron as f. Here, a symmetric aggregation operator is
defined as an operator that can take an arbitrary (finite) number of arguments in arbitrary
order, is increasing in all of its arguments, takes value 0 when all arguments are 0 and
takes value 1 when all arguments are 1. Also, upon a single argument, f acts as the identity,

Dawyndt2006,":So basically, all that is done, is to start from all edges, sorted by edge weight, and then searching for the third node in the graph, eventually changing its edge weight. As a result, one gets a transitive closure of the whole graph. This may be useful to be tested in detail.","UPGMA, transitive closure, clustering, partitioning, graph theory"

common node with the selected edge. In order to cover the latter situation, which can def-

Smith1970,"SALISBURY1 has argued that there is an apparent contradiction between two fundamental concepts of biology—the belief that the gene is a unique sequence of nucleotides whose function it is to determine the sequence of amino-acids in a protein, and the theory of evolution by natural selection. In brief, he calculated that the number of possible amino-acid sequences is greater by many orders of magnitude than the number of proteins which could have existed on Earth since the origin of life, and hence that functionally effective proteins have a vanishingly small chance of arising by mutation. Natural selection is therefore ineffective because it lacks the essential raw material—favourable mutations.","biological parallels, random mutation, natural selection, protein structure, protein space, protein evolution, compositionality"
Smith1970,"I shall assume that mutations, while not random in a chemical sense, are random as far as their chances of improving the funciton of the corresponding proteins are concerened. I shall also assume that evolution has occurred either by the natural selection of favourable mutations or by the chance fixation by genetic drift of selectively neutral mutations. The justification for makeing these assumptions is that no sensible alternatives have been suggested and that no evidence exists at the moment to invalidate them. [...]

The model of protein evolution I want to discuss is best understood by analogy with a popular word game. The object of the gam eis to pass from one word to antoehr of the same length by chaning one letter at a time, with the requirement that all the intermediate words are meaningful in the same language. Thus WORD can be converted into GENE in the minimum number of spes, as follows:

WORD WORE GORE GONE GENE

This is an analogue of evolution, in which the words represent proteins; the letters represent amino-acids; the alteration of a single letter corresponds to the simples evolutionary step, the substitution of one amino-acid for another; and the requirement of meaning correspond to the requirement that each unit step in evolution should be from one functional protein to another. The reason for the last requirement is as follows: suppose that a protein A B C D . . . exists, and that a protein a b C D ... would be favourded by selection if it arose. Suppose further that the intermediates a B C D . . . and A b C D . . .  are non-functional. These forms would arise by mutation, but would usually be eliminated by selection before a second mutation could occur. The double step from a b C D . . . to A B C D would thus be very unlikely to occur. Such double steps with unfavourable intermediates may occasionally occur, but are probably too rare to be important in evolution.","protein evolution, word association, meaning, function, biological parallels, "
Smith1970,"It follows that if evolution by natural selection is to occur, functional proteins must for a continuous network which can be traversed by unit mutational steps without passing through nonfunctional intermediates.

Possible alternatives are that there are two or more distinct networks, or that there is one network with multiple starting points. (ii) How often, if ever, has evolution passed through a non-functional sequence? If so, has this been achieved by the random walk of genese rendered redundant by duplication, or by the chance concurrence of two or more mutations?

genome sequences evident in our biosphere is questionable. Rough calculations show that
neither the mass nor the age of our galaxy is large enough to have generated all the unique proteins
in the biosphere by testing independent random mutations (Salisbury, 1969). This calculation
encouraged John Maynard Smith (@<Smith>1970) to abandon the assumption that random mutations drive
the independent evolution of individual proteins. His alternative formulation is that proteins
form a single network or space of interrelated functional sequences in which mutation has
generated every point in this space from a prior functional protein (Maynard Smith, 1970).","protein evolution, protein space, functional proteins"

transients that are obliterated eventually by random mutation unless the selective factors
change (Kimura, 1983; Berg and Kurland, 2002). Accordingly, it can be inferred that the
phylogenetic network of protein sequences is nested in a network of functional parameters.
Indeed, protein phylogeny seems robust precisely because it reflects the interplay of
conservative structural and functional networks in which the intrusion of novelty is
constrained by intense network interactions, that is to say by purifying selection.","protein evolution, functional protein network, protein derivation"
Cheng2005,"The need for accurate, automated protein classification methods continues to increase as advances in biotechnology uncover new proteins. G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a particularly difficult superfamily of proteins to classify due to extreme diversity among its members. Previous comparisons of BLAST, k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), hidden markov model (HMM) and support vector machine (SVM) using alignment-based features have suggested that classifiers at the complexity of SVM are needed to attain high accuracy. Here, analogous to document classification, we applied Decision Tree and Naïve Bayes classifiers with chi-square feature selection on counts of n-grams (i.e. short peptide sequences of length n) to this classification task. Using the GPCR dataset and evaluation protocol from the previous study, the Naïve Bayes classifier attained an accuracy of 93.0 and 92.4% in level I and level II subfamily classification respectively, while SVM has a reported accuracy of 88.4 and 86.3%. This is a 39.7 and 44.5% reduction in residual error for level I and level II subfamily classification, respectively. The Decision Tree, while inferior to SVM, outperforms HMM in both level I and level II subfamily classification. For those GPCR families whose profiles are stored in the Protein FAMilies database of alignments and HMMs (PFAM), our method performs comparably to a search against those profiles. Finally, our method can be generalized to other protein families by applying it to the superfamily of nuclear receptors with 94.5, 97.8 and 93.6% accuracy in family, level I and level II subfamily classification respectively.","protein classification, text classification, n-gram model, biological parallels"

Moore2010,"Proteins are composed of subunits termed domains that are recurrent units with distinct

proteins, more so than fission events (Ekman et al., 2007; Fong et al., 2007; Kummerfeld

domain insertion or deletion events at protein termini (Vibranovski et al., 2005; Weiner

Here, we investigated such arbitrary conceptual relationships using a non-linguistic picture relatedness task in participants undergoing event-related brain potential recordings. Picture pairs arbitrarily related because of a compound and presented in the compound order elicited N400 amplitudes similar to unrelated pairs. Surprisingly, however, pictures presented in the reverse order (as in the sequence horse–sea) reduced N400 amplitudes significantly, demonstrating the existence of a link in memory between these two concepts otherwise unrelated.

structure. We showed that despite their homogeneous surface structure of
[ver+root+(e)n], ver-verbs differ considerably regarding the root type, the
lexicality of tlie root, and the lexicality of the root+(e)n combination.
Using a lexical decision task in combination with masked morphological
priming, we could show that ver-prefixed verbs undergo morphological
decomposition during visual word recognition (cf. Taft and Forster 1975
and subsequent studies). Additionally, our data show that morphological
decomposition is sensitive to the lexicality of the root+(e)n substring.
While ver-verbs containing a lexical root+(e)n combination are decomposed into a right-branching [ver+[root+(e)n]] structure, ver-verbs with
lion-lexical root+(e)n combinations are decomposed flatly into
[ver+root+(e)n]. Thus, for some ver-verbs both prefix and suffix are processed independently from the root. For other verbs, only the prefix is
stripped from the root and the suffix remains attached to it.
 
This observation is not in line with Taft and Forster's (1975) proposal
that morphological decomposition is mandatory [pb]

Hudson2007b,"This book is a collection of ideas about language—about how language is
structured at every level, about the overall architecture of the whole system,
and about how it fits into a larger framework of ideas about human cognition.
The broad cognitive context is just as important as the detail about language
structure precisely because my argument is that all the detail derives from this
context. Language is not sui generis, a unique system which can, and should,
be studied without reference to any other system; this may have been a healthy
methodological antidote to the psychology of the early twentieth century, but
the intellectual world has changed. Our intellectual neighbours have grown
up into the healthy sciences of cognitive psychology and psycholinguistics,
but intellectual isolationism is still strong on both sides. However well
informed we may be about the neighbours’ comings and goings, neither
side really allows these developments to influence theoretical work on their
side. (Just to give a small example, phonological theories ignore the popular
psychological theory that working memory includes a ‘phonological loop’
(e.g. Baddeley and Logie 1999), which in turn evolved without any significant
input from phonological theory.)","word grammar, network, cognition,"
Booij2009,"Labov (@<Labov>1981, @<Labov>1994) proposed to distinguish two types of phonological change:
change that is phonetically gradual and aspects all relevant words and change that
is phonetically abrupt, replaces a phoneme with another one, and is lexically gradual, that is, exhibits lexical di¤usion. Kiparsky (@<Kiparsky>1988 ) argued that the distinction
between phonetically gradual and phonetically abrupt changes coincides with the
distinction between postlexical and lexical phonological rules. The rules of /d/-weakening and /d/-deletion can indeed be considered lexical rules since they are neu-
tralizing. As expected, they have exceptions and thus exhibit lexical di¤usion. Lexical
di¤usion always creates surface opacity for rules since the speaker will find forms
that have not undergone the rule. Therefore, as stated above, opacity will lead to lexical storage in the sense that for each phonetic form of such words a distinct lexical
entry has to be created. This in its turn explains why semantic distinctions may correlate with phonological di¤erences, as in the pair oude hoer/ouwe hoer discussed
above.","lexical diffusion, gradual sound change, Neogrammarian sound change"
Booij2009,"In this chapter, we saw that the standard view in Generative Phonology of the balance between storage and computation has to be reconsidered. There is a wealth of
evidence for the position that predictable information is stored in the lexicon. First,
recent theoretical developments in phonology imply that predictable information
about morphemes must nevertheless be stored in the lexicon. Second, data concerning phonological change show that computable information concerning the phonetic
realization of morphemes nevertheless has to be stored lexically. I also proposed that [pb] we should take a radical step with respect to the relation between underlying form
and phonetic form: it is not the phonetic form that is computed by the speaker but
rather the underlying form. Like storage in general, storage of phonetic forms of
words will speed up processing; it is only when we coin a new word that computation
of the underlying form of the base word is necessary.
 
These conclusions do not refute the position that the human language faculty has a
dual structure: a lexicon with stored representations and rules. The native speaker
does need rules for the perception and production of novel forms. What, however,
these conclusions do refute is the position that computation and storage of information with respect to the same process or regularity are mutually exclusive.","robustness, redundancy, lexical storage, cognition, "
Laland2015,"Scientific activities take place within the structured sets of ideas and assumptions that define a field and its practices. The conceptual framework of evolutionary biology emerged with the Modern Synthesis in the early twentieth century and has since expanded into a highly successful research program to explore the processes of diversification and adaptation. Nonetheless, the ability of that framework satisfactorily to accommodate the rapid advances in developmental biology, genomics and ecology has been questioned. We review some of these arguments, focusing on literatures (evo-devo, developmental plasticity, inclusive inheritance and niche construction) whose implications for evolution can be interpreted in two ways—one that preserves the internal structure of contemporary evolutionary theory and one that points towards an alternative conceptual framework. The latter, which we label the ‘extended evolutionary synthesis' (EES), retains the fundaments of evolutionary theory, but differs in its emphasis on the role of constructive processes in development and evolution, and reciprocal portrayals of causation. In the EES, developmental processes, operating through developmental bias, inclusive inheritance and niche construction, share responsibility for the direction and rate of evolution, the origin of character variation and organism–environment complementarity. We spell out the structure, core assumptions and novel predictions of the EES, and show how it can be deployed to stimulate and advance research in those fields that study or use evolutionary biology.","extended evolutionary synthesis, new evolutionary synthesis, evolutionary theory"

Du2010,"Clustering is a fundamental data analysis method. It is widely used for pattern recognition, feature extraction, vector quantization (VQ), image segmentation, function approximation, and data mining. As an unsupervised classification technique, clustering identifies some inherent structures present in a set of objects based on a similarity measure. Clustering methods can be based on statistical model identification (McLachlan & Basford, 1988) or competitive learning. In this paper, we give a comprehensive overview of competitive learning based clustering methods. Importance is attached to a number of competitive learning based clustering neural networks such as the self-organizing map (SOM), the learning vector quantization (LVQ), the neural gas, and the ART model, and clustering algorithms such as the CC-means, mountain/subtractive clustering, and fuzzy CC-means (FCM) algorithms. Associated topics such as the under-utilization problem, fuzzy clustering, robust clustering, clustering based on non-Euclidean distance measures, supervised clustering, hierarchical clustering as well as cluster validity are also described. Two examples are given to demonstrate the use of the clustering methods.","neural network, clustering, "

Yanowich2016,"The linguistic notion of “Sapir’s drift” refers to the phenomenon when genetically related lan-
guages, long after their separation, undergo the same or very similar linguistic changes. Such
“drift” may seem almost magical: given that language change is generally a random process,
why would separate linguistic varieties exhibit the same change? There exist possible explana-
tions demystifying Sapir’s drift, including (Joseph, 2012) who argues that if the sister languages
all possessed the same variation in a given construction, that variation can serve as the basis for
parallel changes long after the languages separate. Here, I propose another, complementary,
explanation for Sapir’s drift for changes involving grammatical or semantic reanalysis. The
new account is based on evolutionary modeling in the finite-population setting. All finite pop-
ulations show the effect called genetic drift (unrelated to Sapir’s drift) that delays the effect of
forces pushing the language in a particular direction. For reanalysis-based changes, this means
that even when reanalysis of individual utterances could already occur in the proto-language,
the full takeover by the new form may under the right conditions happen many centuries later,
in the proto-language’s descendants. Given the introduced model, it would have been surprising
if Sapir’s drift never arose, and not the fact that it does.","drift, Edward Sapir, genetic drift, language evolution, Sapir's drift"

Haspelmath1999b,"Grammaticalization, the change by which lexical categories become func-
tional categories, is overwhelmingly irreversible. Prototypical functional
categories never become prototypical lexical categories, and less radical
changes against the general directionality of grammaticalization are
extremely rare. Although the pervasiveness of grammaticalization has long
been known, the question of why this change is irreversible has not been
asked until fairly recently. However, no satisfactory explanation has been
proposed so far. Irreversibility cannot be attributed to the lack of predict-
ability, to the interplay of the motivating factors of economy and clarity,
or to a preference for simple structures in language acquisition.
I propose an explanation that follows the general structure of Keller’s
(1994) invisible-hand theory: language change is shown to result from the
cumulation of countless individual actions of speakers, which are not
intended to change language, but whose side effect is change in a particular
direction. Grammaticalization is a side effect of the maxim of extravagance,
that is, speakers’ use of unusually explicit formulations in order to attract
attention. As these are adopted more widely in the speech community,
they become more frequent and are reduced phonologically. I propose
that degrammaticalization is by and large impossible because there is no
counteracting maxim of ‘‘anti-extravagance,’’ and because speakers have
no conscious access to grammaticalized expressions and thus cannot use
them in place of less grammaticalized ones. This is thus a usage-based
explanation, in which the notion of imperfect language acquisition as the
locus of change plays no role.","invisible hand, grammaticalization, directionality, "

Saavedra2016,"Forms such as -topia in privatopia or -ercise in dancercise are known as blend splinters: they might not be morphemes, but they are clearly involved in word formation. This article offers an automated method that can highlight blend splinters which have the potential to become morphemes in their own right. For instance, the word alcoholic has given rise a large number of blends such as workaholic or rageaholic, so that the splinter -holic is now recognized as a morpheme in the Oxford English Dictionary Online. Because of the sheer number of newly coined blends, it is difficult to identify splinters that are turning into morphemes on the sole basis of human observation. It would therefore be desirable to have an automated method that could process large amounts of data and identify such elements. This article develops such a method, relying on unsupervised morphological segmentation (Harris, 1955). A custom blend database was established for this purpose. The method is able to detect splinters mentioned in previous research, such as -tainment, -ercise, and cyber-, but in addition, it also detects elements that have not been discussed so far, including -tastic, -sumer, and -verse.

We propose a statistical model for inferring a blend's source words drawing on observed linguistic properties of blends; these properties are largely based on the recognizability of the source words in a blend. We annotate a set of 1,186 recently coined expressions which includes 515 blends, and evaluate our methods on a 324-item subset. In this first study of novel blends we achieve an accuracy of 40% on the task of inferring a blend's source words, which corresponds to a reduction in error rate of 39% over an informed baseline. We also give preliminary results showing that our features for source word identification can be used to distinguish blends from other kinds of novel words.","blend splinters, lexical blends, morphological change, word formation"

Here, the central assumption of the model, namely that genome size is independent from chromosome number is reviewed. This assumption is shown to be unrealistic from the perspective of chromosome structure and the statistical analysis of real genomes. A general class of random models, including that random breakage model, is analyzed. For any model within this class, a power law with an exponent of −1 is predicted for the expectation of the mean chromosome size as a function of chromosome length, a functional dependency that is not supported by real genomes. The random breakage and variants keeping genome size and chromosome number independent raise no serious objection to the relevance of correlations consistent with Menzerath–Altmann law across taxonomic groups and the possibility of a connection between human language and genomes through that law.","Menzerath-Altmann law, biological parallels, "

The effects on retrieval of variations in term specificity are examined, experiments with three test collections showing in particular that frequently‐occurring terms are required for good overall performance. It is argued that terms should be weighted according to collection frequency, so that matches on less frequent, more specific, terms are of greater value than matches on frequent terms. Results for the test collections show that considerable improvements in performance are obtained with this very simple procedure.","information retrieval, inverse document frequency, document frequency"

Thompson2016,"A central debate in cognitive science concerns the nativist hypoth-
esis, the proposal that universal features of behavior reflect a
biologically determined cognitive substrate: For example, linguis-
tic nativism proposes a domain-specific faculty of language that
strongly constrains which languages can be learned. An evolu-
tionary stance appears to provide support for linguistic nativism,
because coordinated constraints on variation may facilitate com-
munication and therefore be adaptive. However, language, like
many other human behaviors, is underpinned by social learning
and cultural transmission alongside biological evolution. We set
out two models of these interactions, which show how culture can
facilitate rapid biological adaptation yet rule out strong nativiza-
tion. The amplifying effects of culture can allow weak cognitive
biases to have significant population-level consequences, radically
increasing the evolvability of weak, defeasible inductive biases;
however, the emergence of a strong cultural universal does not
imply, nor lead to, nor require, strong innate constraints. From
this we must conclude, on evolutionary grounds, that the strong
nativist hypothesis for language is false. More generally, because
such reciprocal interactions between cultural and biological evo-
lution are not limited to language, nativist explanations for many
behaviors should be reconsidered: Evolutionary reasoning shows
how we can have cognitively driven behavioral universals and yet
extreme plasticity at the level of the individual—if, and only if, we
account for the human capacity to transmit knowledge culturally.
Wherever culture is involved, weak cognitive biases rather than
strong innate constraints should be the default assumption.","nativism, cultural evolution, nativist hypothesis, biological evolution"
Thompson2016,"Culture mediates between the biases of individual learners and
population-level tendencies or universals. This radically changes
the predictions we should make about the language faculty, or
any other system of constrained cultural learning: Specifically,
the evolution of strong domain-specific constraints on learning is
ruled out. Rather, the behavioral universals that these con-
straints are invoked to explain can instead be produced by weak
biases, amplified by cultural transmission. Although we have
framed our model in terms of language and linguistic nativism,
the same account may be applicable to any behavior that is the
product of interactions between culture and biology: Wherever
cognition has been shaped to acquire culturally transmitted be-
haviors, our arguments should apply. We anticipate that cultural
transmission may be amplifying the effects of learning biases in
many domains of human behavior, mimicking the effects of
strong innate constraints and inviting nativist overinterpretation;
identifying these domains is a key priority. The default expla-

Unfortunately, all known algorithms for this problem run in nearly quadratic time.

In this paper we provide evidence that the near-quadratic running time bounds known for the problem of computing edit distance might be {tight}.

Basu2008,"Numerous eukaryotic proteins contain multiple domains. Certain domains show a tendency to occur in diverse domain architectures and can be considered “promiscuous.” These promiscuous domains are, typically, involved in protein–protein interactions and play crucial roles in interaction networks, particularly those that contribute to signal transduction. A systematic comparative-genomic analysis of promiscuous domains in eukaryotes is described. Two quantitative measures of domain promiscuity are introduced and applied to the analysis of 28 genomes of diverse eukaryotes. Altogether, 215 domains are identified as strongly promiscuous. The fraction of promiscuous domains in animals is shown to be significantly greater than that in fungi or plants. Evolutionary reconstructions indicate that domain promiscuity is a volatile, relatively fast-changing feature of eukaryotic proteins, with few domains remaining promiscuous throughout the evolution of eukaryotes. Some domains appear to have attained promiscuity independently in different lineages, for example, animals and plants. It is proposed that promiscuous domains persist within a relatively small pool of evolutionarily stable domain combinations from which numerous rare architectures emerge during evolution. Domain promiscuity positively correlates with the number of experimentally detected domain interactions and with the strength of purifying selection affecting a domain. Thus, evolution of promiscuous domains seems to be constrained by the diversity of their interaction partners. The set of promiscuous domains is enriched for domains mediating protein–protein interactions that are involved in various forms of signal transduction, especially in the ubiquitin system and in chromatin. Thus, a limited repertoire of promiscuous domains makes a major contribution to the diversity and evolvability of eukaryotic proteomes and signaling networks.","promiscuous domain, domain promiscuity, domain evolution, protein domain, bigram analysis"
Miyazawa1994,"Probabilities of all possible correspondences of residues in aligning two proteins are evaluated by assuming that the statistical weight of each alignment is proportional to the exponent of its total similarity score. Based on such probabilities, a probability alignment that includes the most probable correspondences is proposed. In the case of highly similar sequence pairs, the probability alignments agree with the maximum similarity alignments that correspond to the alignments with the maximum similarity score. Significant correspondences in the probability alignments are those whose probabilities are > 0.5. The probability alignment method is applied to a few protein pairs, and results indicate that such highly probable correspondences in the probability alignments are probably correct correspondences that agree with the structural alignments and that incorrect correspondences in the maximum similarity alignments are usually insignificant correspondences in the probability alignments. The root mean square deviations in superimposition of corresponding residues tend to be smaller for significant correspondences in the probability alignments than for all correspondences in the maximum similarity alignments, indicating that incorrect correspondences in the maximum similarity alignments tend to be insignificant correspondences in probability alignments. This fact is also confirmed in 109 protein pairs that are similar to each other with sequence identities between 90 and 35%. In addition, the probability alignment method may better predict correct correspondences than the maximum similarity alignment method. Probability alignments do, of course, depend on a scoring scheme but are less sensitive to the value of parameters such as gap penalties. The present probability alignment method is useful for constructing reliable alignments based on the probabilities of correspondences and can be used with any scoring scheme.","sequence alignment, sound correspondences, residue correspondences, probability models"

Roth2005,"Agents producing and exchanging knowledge are forming as a whole a socio-semantic complex
system. Studying such knowledge communities offers theoretical challenges, with the perspective
of naturalizing further social sciences, as well as practical challenges, with potential applications
enabling agents to know the dynamics of the system they are participating in. The present thesis
lies within the framework of this research program. Alongside and more broadly, we address
the question of reconstruction in social science. Reconstruction is a reverse problem consisting
of two issues: (i) deduce a given high-level observation for a considered system from low-level
phenomena; and (ii) reconstruct the evolution of high-level observations from the dynamics of
lower-level objects.

In this respect, we argue that several significant aspects of the structure of a knowledge community
are primarily produced by the co-evolution between agents and concepts, i.e. the evolution of an
epistemic network. In particular, we address the first reconstruction issue by using Galois lattices to
rebuild taxonomies of knowledge communities from low-level observation of relationships between
agents and concepts; achieving ultimately an historical description (inter alia field progress,
decline, specialization, interaction – merging or splitting). We then micro-found various stylized
facts regarding this particular structure, by exhibiting processes at the level of agents accounting
for the emergence of epistemic community structure. After assessing the empirical interaction
and growth processes, and assuming that agents and concepts are co-evolving, we successfully
propose a morphogenesis model rebuilding relevant high-level stylized facts. We finally defend
a general epistemological point related to the methodology of complex system reconstruction,
eventually supporting our choice of a co-evolutionary framework.","social networks, social interaction, bipartite network, artificial agents, multi-agent system, sociology, cultural evolution"

Velde2016,"Exaptation is a concept that originated in evolutionary biology. It refers to the
co-optation of a trait for a new function that is not immediately related to its
former function (Gould & Vrba 1982). It was introduced into linguistics by Roger
Lass, first in a paper in Journal of Linguistics in 1990, and later in his 1997 book
as part of a more general evolutionarily inspired theory of language change. Since
then, it has met with wavering enthusiasm: some scholars have embraced the term
and applied it to a wide range of case studies, but others have been more sceptical,
for various reasons. Some have argued that the transfer of concepts from evo-
lutionary biology to linguistics is in general ill-advised as such transfers ignore
the deep differences between biological evolution and cultural evolution; others
have pointed out that the notion of exaptation is flawed in biology as well or have
taken issue with the specifics of Lass’s understanding of the notion (such as the
junk status of the exapted material, see Section 4.3), and still others have objected
to the term on the grounds that the processes it captures are already covered by
other mechanisms of change.","exaptation, grammaticalization, definition"
Vanhatalo2014,"The Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM) is a method of semantic analysis, used for
various tasks mainly in the field of linguistic research. A crucial part of the theory is the
set of primes, minimal lexical units that are used to explicate words, cultural scripts and
other concepts. Identifying the primes in a new language is an opportunity to reinforce
and/or revisit the theory. The remarks presented in this paper resulted from the
identification process of the Finnish-based NSM primes. The goal of this paper is to
direct attention to some fundamental aspects in the Natural Semantic Metalanguage
theory, especially to the relation between the universal language-independent NSM
concepts and the English-based NSM. A number of remarks are made on the general

Futrell2015,"Explaining the variation between human languages and the con-
straints on that variation is a core goal of linguistics. In the last 20 y,
it has been claimed that many striking universals of cross-linguistic
variation follow from a hypothetical principle that dependency
length—the distance between syntactically related words in a sen-
tence—is minimized. Various models of human sentence produc-
tion and comprehension predict that long dependencies are
difficult or inefficient to process; minimizing dependency length
thus enables effective communication without incurring process-
ing difficulty. However, despite widespread application of this
idea in theoretical, empirical, and practical work, there is not yet
large-scale evidence that dependency length is actually minimized
in real utterances across many languages; previous work has fo-
cused either on a small number of languages or on limited kinds of
data about each language. Here, using parsed corpora of 37 di-
verse languages, we show that overall dependency lengths for all
languages are shorter than conservative random baselines. The
results strongly suggest that dependency length minimization is
a universal quantitative property of human languages and support
explanations of linguistic variation in terms of general properties
of human information processing.","dependency length minimalization, syntax, constraints, language dynamics, "

Goddard2010,"This paper discusses the prefixes *s-, *r-, and *N- in Old Chinese on the
basis of etymological relationships among words in Chinese and the comparison

The study of the prefix *s- has a long history and abundunt literature. This

the comparative study of Sino-Tibetan languages.
The prefix *r- is proposed based on the reconstructions of *tr- and *tsr- in
Old Chinese by Fang-kuei Li. The correspondences between Chinese and
Tibeto-Burman reveal that *r- occurred before initial consonants and sometimes
played the role of a prefix.
The hypothesis of the prefix *N- in Old Chinese is put forward on the basis
of Sino Tibetan comparison, in order to account for regular as well as irregular
sound correspondences between Chinese and Tibetan, etymological relationships
among Chinese words, Xie-sheng contacts in Chinese characters, and sound

Mendez2016,"Sequencing the genomes of extinct hominids has reshaped our understanding of modern human origins. Here, we analyze ~120 kb of
exome-captured Y-chromosome DNA from a Neandertal individual from El Sidrón, Spain. We investigate its divergence from ortho-
logous chimpanzee and modern human sequences and find strong support for a model that places the Neandertal lineage as an outgroup
to modern human Y chromosomes—including A00, the highly divergent basal haplogroup. We estimate that the time to the most recent
common ancestor (TMRCA) of Neandertal and modern human Y chromosomes is ~588 thousand years ago (kya) (95% confidence
interval [CI]: 447–806 kya). This is ~2.1 (95% CI: 1.7–2.9) times longer than the TMRCA of A00 and other extant modern human
Y-chromosome lineages. This estimate suggests that the Y-chromosome divergence mirrors the population divergence of Neandertals
and modern human ancestors, and it refutes alternative scenarios of a relatively recent or super-archaic origin of Neandertal
Y chromosomes. The fact that the Neandertal Y we describe has never been observed in modern humans suggests that the lineage
is most likely extinct. We identify protein-coding differences between Neandertal and modern human Y chromosomes, including
potentially damaging changes to PCDH11Y, TMSB4Y, USP9Y, and KDM5D. Three of these changes are missense mutations in genes
that produce male-specific minor histocompatibility (H-Y) antigens. Antigens derived from KDM5D, for example, are thought to elicit
a maternal immune response during gestation. It is possible that incompatibilities at one or more of these genes played a role in the

Szeto2000,"Intelligibility is often used to classify speech varieties as languages or dialects. In drawing the
distinction, the degree of intelligibility between speakers of two different speech varieties can
often indicate how close these varieties are. While talking about intelligibility as a criterion for
the language-dialect classification or to group dialects of one language family, linguistic aspects
like phonological and lexical factors are usually considered. Grammatical factors, on the other
hand, are normally not focussed upon when intelligibility is being concerned. Grammatical
divergence is an important factor in distinguishing different languages within one language
family.
 
The Chinese dialects vary in lexical, phonological as well as grammatical aspects. Their
complicated relationships with each other are often comparable to those between different
languages within a family (Ramsey 1989). Even within one dialect group speech varieties may
show great contrast, a well-known example being the Min supergroup where the different
branches bear some grammatical differences, and also the Yue dialect group as suggested by
Killingley (1993): “Yue dialects ... reveal significant differences which would and do prevent

Ku2015,"Endosymbiotic theory in eukaryotic-cell evolution rests upon a
foundation of three cornerstone partners—the plastid (a cyano-
bacterium), the mitochondrion (a proteobacterium), and its host
(an archaeon)—and carries a corollary that, over time, the majority
of genes once present in the organelle genomes were relinquished
to the chromosomes of the host (endosymbiotic gene transfer).
However, notwithstanding eukaryote-specific gene inventions,
single-gene phylogenies have never traced eukaryotic genes to
three single prokaryotic sources, an issue that hinges crucially
upon factors influencing phylogenetic inference. In the age of
genomes, single-gene trees, once used to test the predictions of
endosymbiotic theory, now spawn new theories that stand to
eventually replace endosymbiotic theory with descriptive, gene
tree-based variants featuring supernumerary symbionts: prokary-
otic partners distinct from the cornerstone trio and whose exis-
tence is inferred solely from single-gene trees. We reason that the
endosymbiotic ancestors of mitochondria and chloroplasts brought
into the eukaryotic—and plant and algal—lineage a genome-sized
sample of genes from the proteobacterial and cyanobacterial pan-
genomes of their respective day and that, even if molecular phy-
logeny were artifact-free, sampling prokaryotic pangenomes through
endosymbiotic gene transfer would lead to inherited chimerism.
Recombination in prokaryotes (transduction, conjugation, transfor-
mation) differs from recombination in eukaryotes (sex). Prokaryotic
recombination leads to pangenomes, and eukaryotic recombina-
tion leads to vertical inheritance. Viewed from the perspective of
endosymbiotic theory, the critical transition at the eukaryote origin
that allowed escape from Muller’s ratchet—the origin of eukary-
otic recombination, or sex—might have required surprisingly little

In this paper some problems of phonological reconstruction in PIE are
discussed from a typological perspective. First, one of the most controver-

non-explosive non-glottalic stops) and voiced explosives that changed to
voiced explosives and breathy voiced stops in PIE or at least in the central
IE languages.

In the second part, the focus lies on the reconstruction of qualitative
ablaut in vowels. In the light of typological parallels it is argued that both

This data can be explored based on various phonetic criteria, and sound change distributions can be represented on a geographical map or on a language family tree.

Many quality evaluation metrics for graph clustering have been proposed in the literature, but there is no consensus on how do they compare to each other and how well they perform on different kinds of graphs. In this work we study five major graph clustering quality metrics in terms of their formal biases and their behavior when applied to clusters found by four implementations of classic graph clustering algorithms on five large, real world graphs. Our results show that those popular quality metrics have strong biases toward incorrectly awarding good scores to some kinds of clusters, especially seen in larger networks. They also indicate that currently used clustering algorithms and quality metrics do not behave as expected when cluster structures are different from the more traditional, clique-like ones.","conductance, graph clustering quality, evaluation"

BollAvetisyan2016,"Many languages restrict their lexicons by OCP-P LACE , a phonotactic constraint against co-occurrences of consonants with shared
[place] (e.g., McCarthy, 1986). While many previous studies have suggested that listeners have knowledge of OCP-P LACE and use this for
speech processing, it is less clear whether they make reference to an abstract representation of this constraint. In Dutch, OCP-P LACE
gradiently restricts non-adjacent consonant co-occurrences in the lexicon. Focusing on labial-vowel-labial co-occurrences, we found that
there are, however, exceptions from the general effect of OCP-L ABIAL : (A) co-occurrences of identical labials are systematically less
restricted than co-occurrences of homorganic labials, and (B) some specific pairs (e.g., /pVp/, /bVv/) occur more often than expected.
Setting out to study whether exceptions such as (A) and (B) had an effect on processing, the current study presents an artificial language
learning experiment and a reanalysis of Boll-Avetisyan and Kager’s (2014) speech segmentation data. Results indicate that Dutch
listeners can use both knowledge of phonotactic detail and an abstract constraint OCP-L ABIAL as a cue for speech segmentation. We
suggest that whether detailed or abstract representations are drawn on depends on the complexity of processing demands.","speech processing, phonotactics, obligatory contour principle"

Dimitrov2011,"The objective of our work is to develop a general method for structurally related, but diverged sequences for
simultaneous optimization of alignment and self-folding - the so-called Sankoff's program for simultaneous
prediction of secondary structure and alignment between nucleotide sequences. A simple reason behind the
simultaneous optimization of alignment and self-folding is that strong structural consensus among related, but
diverged sequences are a good indicator for preserved functional role. Up to now there is no a general solution
for this long standing problem.
Here we discuss an approach which is just a first step to the full realization of Sankoff's program. Currently
available models and software packages, such as foldalign, dynalign and others, implement only restricted
versions (variations around first align and then fold or oppositely) of Sunkoff's program and do not use the full
loop-based RNA/DNA energy model.
We divided Sankof's program in two steps based on the analogy between the classical alignment algorithm and
hybridization without self-folding. The next step is to include in the alignment an algorithm for the self-folding.
In our approach, the alignment problem requires the implementation of the full loop-based RNA/DNA energy
model for hybridization of two sequences. For this, we divided the alignment between two sequences into loops
and associated a score to each loop in such way that the total score of the alignment is a sum over the scores for
each alignment loop. The loop scoring model for alignment consists of following loop types: stacking with
matched and mismatched pairs, bulges, internal loops and dangling ends.
Calculation of thermodynamic partition function over all possible double-stranded conformations is interpreted
in terms of all possible canonical pairwise alignments. The partition function is computed by means of a
dynamic programming algorithm and used to determine the probability of an alignment as well as the
probability of each possible match between two sequence positions. For calculation of match probabilities
detailed recursion relations for partition functions of alignments are based on their recursion analogs for

Southern Qiang, a Tibeto-Burman language located squarely in the East Asian

influence from Chinese, the tone system found in Mianchi fits an ‘African’

similarities.","case study, African languages, Sino-Tibetan, Qiang, Southern Qiang, tone, tonogenesis"
Fon2011,"This paper reports a dialectal split in syllable-final nasal mergers between
northern and southern Taiwan Mandarin: both /in/ → [iŋ] and /əŋ/ → [ən] are
found in northerners’ speech, while an additional /iŋ/ → [in] is reported among
southerners. The former two mergers are treated as innovations while the latter is
due to negative Min transfer. Rule connotation seems to be a combined result of
origin, analogy, and speaker confidence. /iŋ/ → [in] is stigmatized due to Min
transfer, /əŋ/  [ən] has acquired a slight negative tang by analogy, and /in/  [iŋ]
is deemed as fairly positive. Regardless of rules, northerners, being speakers of the
standard dialect, are generally more receptive to merged forms than southerners. A
positive correlation is found between rule connotation and development. /in/ →
[iŋ] is the closest to complete phonologization, followed by /əŋ/ → [ən], and /iŋ/
 [in], which is the least developed. Rule interaction is found in speakers that
have both rules involving /i/. Those who have only one rule show higher merging
rates than those who have both rules. Conflict of social connotation and increased

language is more flexible and powerful; the connection way among Spanish words is more
stringent and this indicates that the Spanish grammar is more rigorous; values of many
statistical parameters of the French and Spanish networks are very approximate and this
shows that these two languages share many commonalities; Arabic and Russian words
have many varieties, which result in rich types of words and a sparse connection among
words; connections among Chinese words obey a more uniform distribution, and one
inclines to use the least number of Chinese words to express the same complex information
as those in other five languages. This shows that the expression of Chinese language is quite

Gong2003,"There have been different ways of sub-grouping Sino-Tibetan languages.
Benedict (1972) sets up two sub-groups, which are Chinese and Tibeto-Karen, and
subdivides Tibeto-Karen into Tibeto-Burman and Karen. Bradley (1979) and
Matisoff (1986) consider it unnecessary to posit an intermediate “Tibeto-Karen”
level. They regard Karenic as a subfamily of Tibeto-Burman, on the same taxonomic
level as Lolo-Burmese of Kuki-Chin-Naga.
On the basis of this sub-grouping, this paper discusses the phonological
changes of finals that had occurred when Proto-Sino-Tibetan split into Old Chinese

Proto-Tibeto-Burman on Benedict (1972), and Proto-Sino-Tibetan on Gong (1995).

Various scholars have proposed different hypotheses concerning the origin of
these two features. Through analysis of their phonetic aspects, it is argued that the
features cannot be the result of recent contact with nearby Wu dialects, but must
have been conditioned by a feature found in Proto-Northern Min, most likely a

the possibility that they entered Proto-Northern Min from another dialect source,

distinction proposed have been shown to be unreliable and thus rejected. We
re-examine these two tests closely and propose two sets of refined, reliable, and

synthetic propositions to characterize the C/M distinction. M is therefore
semantically substantive and thus blocks numeral quantification and adjectival
modification to the noun; C, in contrast, does not form such a barrier, for it is
semantically null in the sense that it merely highlights a semantic aspect inherent
to the noun and thus contributes no additional meaning.","measure words, classifier system, Mandarin, Chinese"

Lin2011,"This paper investigates Dongshi Hakka tone sandhi within the output-oriented
framework of Optimality Theory (OT, Prince & Smolensky 1993[2004], McCarthy

in Dongshi Hakka. The first force is assimilatory in nature and forces intersyllabic
tone features to agree. Completely contradictory to this force is a dissimilatory
effect that requires elements at the tonal level and the contour level to be different.
These facts are captured by N O J UMP -t, OCP-T(11), OCP- C ( ), and OCP- C ( ),
which regulate the well-formedness of tonal combination. In addition to tonal
sequential markedness, the markedness status of a tone itself also plays a role. A
low register tone occurring in a head position is shown to be marked and indirectly
decides whether a tonal combination that violates a certain sequential markedness
constraint will undergo tone sandhi. This can be explicitly captured by the con-
junction of tonal and sequential markedness constraints.","case study, Hakka, Dongshi Hakka, tone sandhi"

guiding the processing of conceptual information, whereas conceptual meaning includes information about the representation of entities,
for instance objects or events. Conceptual information for connectives is described at the level of entailment, explicature and implicature,
and may indicate possible causal relations among the events described, whereas procedural information for causal connectives is
restricted to indicating the direction of the causal relation (forward or backward). Conceptual information for tenses specifies temporal
coordinates, while procedural meaning specifies directional and subjective properties of events, using features such as [narrative] or
[subjective]. A second goal is to answer a central question for pragmatics: what is the contribution of connectives, that is, what is the
difference between discourses with and without connectives? The pragmatic framework adopted, which is based on Relevance Theory,
gives the following answer: in a discourse without connectives, the accessibility of the intended interpretation depends solely on the
context, whereas the use of connectives allows a simpler route, reducing the number of inferential steps and helping to determine
semantic and pragmatic contents such as entailments, explicatures and implicatures.","procedural meaning, context, semantics, meaning, meaning potential"

The analysis shows that the pharyngealized vowel originated mostly from

conceptual structure and propose a relativist view of conceptual structures under-
lying different languages. Spatial expressions in Chinese and English are used to
explore this view. Spatial expressions in sign language are also considered to
deepen our understanding of conceptual structure. We take issue with the theory
of conceptual semantics advocated by Jackendoff for the past two decades. We
present a view that “creativity” and “generativity” resides largely in conceptual
component, and only derivatively in syntactic component. Thus, the process of
“syntacticization” is essentially on a par with lexicalization. We argue that syn-
tactic patterns reflect conceptualizations in different languages and cultures and
genuine cases of syntax-semantics mismatch are greatly reduced and hence
simpler syntax. We also show how pragmatic inferences can be used to simplify
syntactic structure, using word order, argument selection, and contextual expres-

non-autonomous theory of syntax with minimal requirement of tentative innate
linguistic structure.","conceptual semantics, sign language, English, Chinese, conceptualization, cognitive linguistics"
Wang2015,"The tonal system in Jianchuan Bai has attracted much attention for its
complex combinations of pitch and phonation type. In this paper, 1 based on
EGG signals, three parameters, namely F0, Open Quotient (OQ) and Speed
Quotient (SQ), are extracted to examine the tonal quality. It is found that
there are two non-modal phonation types, Harsh and Pressed, and roughly
four groups of pitch pattern (31/31/41; 33/433; 55/54; 35) in the eight tonal
categories. One pair of tones can only be distinguished from each other by
phonation type since their pitches are the same. As for other pairs, both pitch
and phonation type may contribute to the distinction between them. Notably,
non-modal phonation types vary across different Bai speakers. For a
particular non-modal tone, one speaker may employ harsh voice, while
another may use pressed voice. Sometimes, the non-modal phonation type
even changed within a syllable. It is then suggested that different strategies
may be used to produce non-modal tones in contrast with their modal
counterpart. Moreover, based on the Bai data, how to define different
phonation types based on the three basic parameters, F0, OQ and SQ, is
discussed. Harsh voice is a better term for the type with the laryngeal features

Wee2010,"This paper presents data from Tianjin tritonal sandhi patterns that challenge
both traditional derivational approaches and standard Optimality Theoretic (OT)
approaches to phonological alternation. If construed derivationally, Tianjin tritonal
sandhi requires derivational reversals; but if construed within OT, involves combi-
nations of opacity and transparency. The account proposed here appeals to a
percolative model where phonological information from terminal nodes finds
correspondences in higher nodes, such that the correspondences may be imperfect
when triggered by markedness requirements. While this requires a total re-
conceptualization of phonological representations, this paper argues that it is well
worth it because it predicts that: (1) directionality is a derivate from branching;
(2) the depth of derivational opacity is confined by structural depth; (3) constituency,
not adjacency, provides the environment for triggering alternation so alternation
rules can therefore be blocked when marked collocations belong to different
constituencies; and (4) underlying entities can have split surface correspondences.","Tianjin Chinese, Chinese dialects, case study, tone sandhi"

We propose a number of measures of assortative mixing appropriate to the various mixing types, and apply them to a variety of real-world networks, showing that assortative mixing is a pervasive phenomenon found in many networks. We also propose several models of assortatively mixed networks, both analytic ones based on generating function methods, and numerical ones based on Monte Carlo graph generation techniques. We use these models to probe the properties of networks as their level of assortativity is varied. In the particular case of mixing by degree, we find strong variation with assortativity in the connectivity of the network and in the resilience of the network to the removal of vertices.","assortative mixing, networks, assortativity, network partitioning, cluster evaluation, evaluation"

Zhang2014a,"Together with the sign (positive or negative) and strength (strong or

though usually ignored in undirected social networks for its invis-

and the awareness of directionality can improve our understand-
ing about the network structures and further benefit social network
analysis and mining tasks. Thus it’s appealing to study whether
there exist interesting patterns about directionality in social net-
works and whether we can learn the directions for undirected net-
works based on these patterns.

In this study, we engage in the investigation of directionality pat-
terns on real-world directed social networks and summarize our
findings using four consistency hypotheses. Based on these hy-
potheses, we propose ReDirect, an optimization framework which
makes it possible to infer the hidden directions of undirected social
ties based on the network topology only. This general framework
can incorporate various predictive models under specific scenarios.
Furthermore, we show how to improve ReDirect by introducing
semi/self-supervision in the framework and how to construct the
self-labeled training data using simple but effective heuristics. Ex-
perimental results show that even without external information, our
approach can recover the directions of networks effectively.

Moreover, we’re quite surprising to find that ReDirect can benefit
predictive tasks remarkably, with a case study of link prediction. In
experiments the redirected networks inferred using ReDirect are
proven much more informative than original undirected ones and
can improve the prediction performance significantly. It convinces
us that ReDirect can be a beneficial general data preprocess tool

Calude2016,"Numerals have fascinated and mystified linguists, mathematicians and lay persons alike for centuries.
The productive use of numerals (in languages where this happens) exploits recursivity to give rise to
what we call the ‘the number line’. While the smaller numerals 1–10 have enjoyed intense scrutiny,
the typological study of the formation of the higher numerals has received comparatively less atten-
tion. This article contains a comprehensive typological account of how languages in the Indo-
European language family code numerals beyond 10 (10–99, 100s, 1,000s), the morphemes involved,
and how these are ordered. We use this dataset from eighty-one Indo-European languages with
phylogenetic comparative methods to propose diachronic reconstructions of these patterns in the
Proto-Indo-European language. Our findings indicate that small numerals (11–19) show the widest
cross-linguistic variation, and that higher numerals exhibit more consistency in both component parts
and their ordering. Additionally, we show statistical evidence of correlations between the ordering of
base and atom morphemes and other word order patterns (noun-postposition, noun-genitive, and
verb-object order).","numerals, Indo-European, ancestral state reconstruction, "

elements that replaced most of the original Eastern Slavic and Sorbian vocabularies, while keeping the original grammars intact.","population genetics, Yiddish, archaeogenetics"
Francois2016,"Linguistic diffusion is commonly equated with contact, and contrasted with genealogy. This
article takes a new perspective, by showing how diffusion lies in fact at the heart of
language genealogy itself. Indeed, the Comparative method has taught us to identify genetic
subgroups based on sets of shared innovations; but each of these innovations necessarily
had to diffuse from speaker to speaker across a network of then mutually intelligible
idiolects. Such a diffusionist approach to language genealogy allows us to model language
change as it really took place in the social and geographical space of past societies.

Crucially, the entangled isoglosses typical of dialect continuums and linkages (Ross
1988) cannot be handled by the Tree model, which is solely based on divergence; but they
are easily captured by a diffusionist approach such as the Wave model, where the key
process is convergence. After comparing the theoretical underpinnings of these two models,
I introduce Historical Glottometry, a new quantitative approach aiming to free the
Comparative Method from any cladistic assumption, and to reconcile it with a wave-based
analysis. Finally, data from a group of Oceanic languages from Vanuatu illustrate the
powerful potential of Glottometry as a new method for linguistic subgrouping.","networks, wave theory, linguistic diffusion, linkages, genetic relationship, linguistic area"
Huth2016,"The meaning of language is represented in regions of the cerebral cortex collectively known as the ‘semantic system’.
However, little of the semantic system has been mapped comprehensively, and the semantic selectivity of most regions
is unknown. Here we systematically map semantic selectivity across the cortex using voxel-wise modelling of functional
MRI (fMRI) data collected while subjects listened to hours of narrative stories. We show that the semantic system is
organized into intricate patterns that seem to be consistent across individuals. We then use a novel generative model to
create a detailed semantic atlas. Our results suggest that most areas within the semantic system represent information
about specific semantic domains, or groups of related concepts, and our atlas shows which domains are represented in
each area. This study demonstrates that data-driven methods—commonplace in studies of human neuroanatomy and
functional connectivity—provide a powerful and efficient means for mapping functional representations in the brain.","neurology, semantic map, semantic network, "
Lamarre2014,"How many words – and which ones – are sufficient to define all other words?
When dictionaries are analyzed as directed graphs with links from defining words to defined
words, they reveal a latent structure. Recursively removing all words that are reachable by
definition but that do not define any further words reduces the dictionary to a Kernel of
about 10%. This is still not the smallest number of words that can define all the rest. About
75% of the Kernel turns out to be its Core, a “Strongly Connected Subset” of words with a
definitional path to and from any pair of its words and no word’s definition depending on a
word outside the set. But the Core cannot define all the rest of the dictionary. The 25% of
the Kernel surrounding the Core consists of small strongly connected subsets of words: the
Satellites. The size of the smallest set of words that can define all the rest – the graph’s
“minimum feedback vertex set” or MinSet – is about 1% of the dictionary,15% of the Kernel,
and half-Core/half-Satellite. But every dictionary has a huge number of MinSets. The Core
words are learned earlier, more frequent, and less concrete than the Satellites, which in turn
are learned earlier and more frequent but more concrete than the rest of the Dictionary. In
principle, only one MinSet’s words would need to be grounded through the sensorimotor
capacity to recognize and categorize their referents. In a dual-code sensorimotor/symbolic
model of the mental lexicon, the symbolic code could do all the rest via re-combinatory
definition.","dictionary, semantic network, language model, semantic similarity"
Leslie2004,"**Motivation:** Classification of proteins sequences into func-
tional and structural families based on sequence homology
is a central problem in computational biology. Discriminat-
ive supervised machine learning approaches provide good
performance, but simplicity and computational efficiency of
training and prediction are also important concerns.

**Results:** We introduce a class of string kernels, called
mismatch kernels, for use with support vector machines (SVMs)
in a discriminative approach to the problem of protein clas-
sification and remote homology detection. These kernels
measure sequence similarity based on shared occurrences
of fixed-length patterns in the data, allowing for mutations
between patterns. Thus, the kernels provide a biologically well-
motivated way to compare protein sequences without relying
on family-based generative models such as hidden Markov
models. We compute the kernels efficiently using a mismatch
tree data structure, allowing us to calculate the contributions
of all patterns occurring in the data in one pass while travers-
ing the tree. When used with an SVM, the kernels enable fast
prediction on test sequences. We report experiments on two
benchmark SCOP datasets, where we show that the mismatch
kernel used with an SVM classifier performs competitively with
state-of-the-art methods for homology detection, particularly
when very few training examples are available. Examination of
the highest-weighted patterns learned by the SVM classifier
recovers biologically important motifs in protein families and

Wang2014a,"In the context of genetics and breeding research on multiple phenotypic traits, reconstructing the directional or causal
structure between phenotypic traits is a prerequisite for quantifying the effects of genetic interventions on the traits.
Current approaches mainly exploit the genetic effects at quantitative trait loci (QTLs) to learn about causal relationships
among phenotypic traits. A requirement for using these approaches is that at least one unique QTL has been identified for
each trait studied. However, in practice, especially for molecular phenotypes such as metabolites, this prerequisite is often
not met due to limited sample sizes, high noise levels and small QTL effects. Here, we present a novel heuristic search
algorithm called the QTL+phenotype supervised orientation (QPSO) algorithm to infer causal directions for edges in
undirected phenotype networks. The two main advantages of this algorithm are: first, it does not require QTLs for each and
every trait; second, it takes into account associated phenotypic interactions in addition to detected QTLs when orienting
undirected edges between traits. We evaluate and compare the performance of QPSO with another state-of-the-art
approach, the QTL-directed dependency graph (QDG) algorithm. Simulation results show that our method has broader
applicability and leads to more accurate overall orientations. We also illustrate our method with a real-life example involving
24 metabolites and a few major QTLs measured on an association panel of 93 tomato cultivars. Matlab source code
implementing the proposed algorithm is freely available upon request.","causal inference, phenotype network, directionality"

the models' performances on a large dataset of semantic priming (Hutchison et al., 2013) and

psychologically plausible learning principles. As an aid to researchers, we release semantic

among the public, but has been greatly exaggerated through popularization and is therefore

claim, to our knowledge the line of reasoning behind it has not been tested broadly across
languages. Here, we note that this reasoning is a special case of the more general view that
language is shaped by the need for efficient communication, and we empirically test a vari-

large digital collections of linguistic and meteorological data. Consistent with the hypothesis
of efficient communication, we find that languages that use the same linguistic form for
snow and ice tend to be spoken in warmer climates, and that this association appears to be
mediated by lower communicative need to talk about snow and ice. Our results confirm that
variation in semantic categories across languages may be traceable in part to local commu-

for snow” may play a useful role as an accessible instance of the principle that language

The latter had capitalized upon an idea of Constantin Rafinesque, poet, supposed lost Dauphin, finder or frger of the Delaware Indian *Walam Olumn*, a man of both genuine and spurious claims to scientific repute.

Reinoehl2016,"It has been widely assumed that the primary adpositions of modern
Indo-European languages constitute a historically identical category, descending
from the Proto-Indo-European ‘local particles’. I argue that this assumption
needs to be revised, because a major branch of the language family, Indo-Aryan,
possesses adpositions of unrelated origin. This is not only a question of different
etyma, but the New Indo-Aryan adpositions descend from structurally different
sources. The ancient local particles, as attested in early Indo-Aryan varieties,
combine with local case forms and show a preference for the prenominal position.
By contrast, the New Indo-Aryan adpositions descend from nominal and verbal
forms heading genitives, and show a propensity for the postnominal slot. Thus,
we are dealing with elements unrelated not only etymologically, but also with
regard to their morphosyntactic distribution.","Indo-European, adposition, local particle, genetic classification, ancestral state reconstruction"
Hume2016,"In this paper we propose that insight into the unmarked nature of these patterns can be gained when we
take seriously the view of language as a system of information transmission. In particular, we suggest that
perceptually weak and strong unmarked patterns are those that effectively balance two competing
properties of effective communication: (a) the contribution of the phonological unit in context to accurate
message transmission, and (b) the resource cost of the phonological unit (see Hall, Hume, Jaeger & Wedel,
forthcoming). In order to demonstrate this, we begin in §2 by describing key properties of language as a
system of information transmission. In the following section, we turn to the predictions that follow from
such a system for perceptually weak and strong sound patterns and show why it makes sense for them both
to be described as unmarked.","sound patterns, markedness, phonotactics, information theory, language model"

a. Enhance redundancy on phonological-units-in-context that will contribute the most to successful message transmission, while having the least negative impact on resource cost.
b. Reduce redundancy in phonological-units-in-context that will provide the least benefit to successful message transmission, thereby reducing resource cost.","sound patterns, phonotactics, redundancy, message modification"
Hume2016,"With this as a basis, we return to the issue of why perceptually weak and strong sound patterns can
both pattern as unmarked. The solution to this problem is that in both patterns, there is an effective trade-off
between a PUC's resource cost and its potential contribution to accurate transmission of the message. In an
effective system of information transfer, stable sound patterns with weak perceptual cues are predicted to
be associated with PUCs that contribute little to message transmission accuracy; that is, the PUC has high
relative predictability within the message, by occurring for example, toward the end of the word, or in a
high frequency affix or function word. Investing resources in a PUC that contributes little to message
identity is not cost-effective. Conversely, it is worthwhile to invest in PUCs that make a strong contribution
to message transmission accuracy. Stable patterns with perceptually strong sounds are thus predicted to
occur in contexts that are informative since strong perceptual cues support the transmission of
unpredictable information, e.g. beginning of words, content words (as opposed to affixes/function words).
Stable PUCs with strong cues occur toward the upper right quadrant of the figure in (5), while those with
weak cues are located in the lower left quadrant.","stability, sound patterns, context, phonotactics, redundancy"
Hume2016,"This paper offers an interesting idea regarding strength and weakness in sound patterns, and how they could be determined based on information-theoretic principles.

Wallis2013a,"Many statistical methods rely on an underlying mathematical model of probability based on a simple approximation, one that is simultaneously well-known and yet frequently misunderstood. The Normal approximation to the Binomial distribution underpins a range of statistical tests and methods, including the calculation of accurate confidence intervals, performing goodness of fit and contingency tests, line- and model-fitting, and computational methods based upon these. A common mistake is in assuming that, since the probable distribution of error about the “true value” in the population is approximately Normally distributed, the same can be said for the error about an observation.
This paper is divided into two parts: fundamentals and evaluation. First, we examine the estimation of confidence intervals using three initial approaches: the “Wald” (Normal) interval, the Wilson score interval and the “exact” Clopper-Pearson Binomial interval. Whereas the first two can be calculated directly from formulae, the Binomial interval must be approximated towards by computational search, and is computationally expensive. However this interval provides the most precise significance test, and therefore will form the baseline for our later evaluations. We also consider two further refinements: employing log-likelihood in intervals (also requiring search) and the effect of adding a continuity correction.
Second, we evaluate each approach in three test paradigms. These are the single proportion interval or 2 × 1 goodness of fit test, and two variations on the common 2 × 2 contingency test. We evaluate the performance of each approach by a “practitioner strategy”. Since standard advice is to fall back to “exact” Binomial tests in conditions when approximations are expected to fail, we report the proportion of instances where one test obtains a significant result when the equivalent exact test does not, and vice versa, across an exhaustive set of possible values.
We demonstrate that optimal methods are based on continuity-corrected versions of the Wilson interval or Yates’ test, and that commonly-held beliefs about weaknesses of tests are misleading. Log-likelihood, often proposed as an improvement on , performs disappointingly. Finally we note that at this level of precision we may distinguish two types of 2 2 test according to whether the independent variable partitions data into independent populations, and we make practical recommendations for their use.","binomial confidence intervals, contingency tests, evaluation"
Wallis2013,"A set of statistical tests termed contingency tests, of which χ2 is the most well-known example, are commonly employed in linguistics research. Contingency tests compare discrete distributions, that is, data divided into two or more alternative categories, such as alternative linguistic choices of a speaker or different experimental conditions.

However, the mathematical underpinnings of these tests are rarely discussed in the literature in an approachable way, with the result that many researchers may apply tests inappropriately, fail to see the possibility of testing particular questions, or draw unsound conclusions. Contingency tests are also closely related to the construction of confidence intervals, which are highly useful and revealing methods for plotting the certainty of experimental observations. This paper is organized in the following way. The foundations of the simplest type of χ2 test, the 2 × 1 goodness of fit test, is introduced and related to the z test for a single observed proportion p and the Wilson score confidence interval about p. We then show how the 2 × 2 test for independence (homogeneity) is derived from two observations p 1 and p 2 and explain when each test should be used. We also briefly introduce the Newcombe-Wilson test, which ideally should be used in preference to the χ test for observations drawn from two independent populations (such as two sub-corpora). We then turn to tests for larger tables, generally termed r × c tests, which have multiple degrees of freedom and therefore may encompass multiple trends, and discuss strategies for their analysis. Finally, we turn briefly to the question of differentiating test results. We introduce the concept of effect size (also termed “measures of association”) and finally explain how we may perform statistical separability tests to distinguish between two sets of results.","xi-square test, contingency tests, evaluation"

Evans2013,"The study of linguistic diversity, and the factors driving change between language

around the world, many on the verge of extinction without trace.

This chapter outlines the various ways coevolutionary models can be applied to
language change, and surveys the many ways diversity manifests itself both in language
structure and in the organization of diversity beyond the language unit. Problems of
establishing comparability and characterizing the full dimensions of the design space
are discussed, including the distribution of characters across it, the correlations between
them, and the challenge of establishing diachronic typologies (i.e., establishing the
likelihood of different types of transition, including the insights that could be reached
through properly focused studies of micro-variation). It concludes by surveying the
main types of selection that mold the emergence of linguistic diversity—psychological/
physiological, system/semiotic, and genetic/ epidemiological—and spells out seven
major challenges that confront further studies of linguistic diversity within an evolu-

explicitly identifying the molecular events that have
led to the observed sequence variation. Gaps can be
created by many different types of events, and these
need to be distinguished, as the alignment might be
different for different events (see the examples in Figs 2

to occur with different frequencies in different sequence
types; for example, tandem repeats are very common
in both protein- and intron-coding sequences, whereas
inversions are most commonly reported in noncoding [pb]

Hill2007,"Traditionally three independent types of analogical change in inflectional para-
digms are distinguished: proportional analogy, paradigmatic leveling and ana-
logical extension. However, the investigation of the data reveals that out of these
types only that of proportional analogy can be empirically verified, being sup-
ported by clear evidence from languages with well documented history. More-
over, as shown by data from Russian, Old High German dialects, Old Saxon,
Old English, and Latin, even in the most secure cases of paradigmatic leveling or
analogical extension found in the literature the assumption of proportional anal-
ogy is either probable or cannot be excluded. Consequently the three traditional
types of analogical change seem to differ with respect to their ontological status.
On the one hand, paradigmatic leveling, i.e. the elimination of allomorphy in
inflectional paradigms, is to be viewed merely as a motivation for change whose
operating principle really is proportional analogy. On the other hand, analogical
extension, i.e., the extension of already existing inflection forms through affixes
with comparable function, seems to be just a possible way to describe the results
of changes which, again, may in fact be instances of proportional analogy. These
findings have the following implications for linguistic theory and practice.

In practical work on inflectional morphology paradigmatic leveling and ana-
logical extension without the use of proportional analogy can no longer be used
in explanations on reconstructed stages of language development. All proposed
explanations of this kind are to be supported by establishing an underlying pro-
portional analogy or reconsidered if this is impossible.","analogy, analogical change, language change, morphological change"

Two research questions were raised in this thesis: 1) whether FoU remains stable over
time, 2) whether amount of language change over time can be predicted using FoU. A
1147-word subset of the IDS wordlist (Key & Comrie, 2007) was used to test these
questions. The FoU of both Latin and Spanish, and amount of change for each word was
measured. There was a lower correlation across time than cross-linguistically, but the
effect of genre could not be removed. A weak, highly significant negative relationship
between FoU and amount of change was identified, supporting the claim that high
frequency words change less than low frequency words. There is an intriguing
correlation between FoU and lexical change, but the causal mechanism is not yet
understood.","language change, frequency, Latin, Spanish, concept list, morphological change, dataset,"

However, an examination of the conditions on these changes brings out an asymmetry. In most cases, transfers of nasality take place from a consonantal onset to a following vowel; the instances we found of a regular change in the opposite direction all come from languages where there is one of the following restrictions on nasal sounds: (i) nasal consonants are nonphonemic (contextually predictable), or (ii) the opposition between nasal and oral vowels is neutralized after nasal consonants (in favor of nasal vowels).

Answering these questions determines the synthetic ‘value’ of the language: where on the
continuum of synthesis should it be placed, more to the isolating end, or more to the
agglutinative end? If the language is placed more to the agglutinative end, one can determine
the amount of fusion in the language. Again the language can be placed on a continuum: more
fusing or more agglutinative. It will also be interesting to see whether the language allows for
incorporation, and if so, to what extent.","sign language, morphology, description, typology"
Diessel2016,"Until recently, theoretical linguists have paid little attention to the frequency of linguistic
elements in grammar and grammatical development. It is a standard assumption of (most)
grammatical theories that the study of grammar (or competence) must be separated from the
study of language use (or performance). However, this view of language has been called into
question by various strands of research that have emphasized the importance of frequency for
the analysis of linguistic structure. In this research, linguistic structure is often characterized
as an emergent phenomenon shaped by general cognitive processes such as analogy,
categorization, and automatization, which are crucially influenced by frequency of
occurrence.
 
There are many different ways in which frequency affects the processing and development of
linguistic structure. Historical linguists have shown that frequent strings of linguistic elements
are prone to undergo phonetic reduction and coalescence and that frequent expressions and
constructions are more resistant to structure mapping and analogical leveling than infrequent
ones. Cognitive linguists have argued that the organization of constituent structure and
embedding is based on the language users’ experience with linguistic sequences and that the
productivity of grammatical schemas or rules is determined by the combined effect of
frequency and similarity. Child language researchers have demonstrated that frequency of
occurrence plays an important role in the segmentation of the speech stream and the
acquisition of syntactic categories and that the statistical properties of the ambient language
are much more regular than commonly assumed. And finally, psycholinguists have shown
that structural ambiguities in sentence processing can often be resolved by lexical and
structural frequencies and that speakers’ choices between alternative constructions in
language production are related to their experience with particular linguistic forms and
meanings. Taken together, this research suggests that our knowledge of grammar is grounded
in experience.","frequency, grammar, typology"
Sapir1921,"What, then, are the absolutely essential concepts in speech, the concepts that must be
expressed if language is to be a satisfactory means of communication? Clearly we must
have, first of all, a large stock of basic or radical concepts, the concrete wherewithal of
speech. We must have objects, actions, qualities to talk about, and these must have
their corresponding symbols in independent words or in radical elements. No
proposition, however abstract its intent, is humanly possible without a tying on at one
or more points to the concrete world of sense. In every intelligible proposition at least
two of these radical ideas must be expressed, though in exceptional cases one or even
both may be understood from the context. And, secondly, such relational concepts must
be expressed as moor the concrete concepts to each other and construct a definite,
fundamental form of proposition. In this fundamental form there must be no doubt as to
the nature of the relations that obtain between the concrete concepts. We must know
what concrete concept is directly or indirectly related to what other, and how. If we
wish to talk of a thing and an action, we must know if they are coordinately related to
each other (e.g., “He is fond of wine and gambling”); or if the thing is conceived of as
the starting point, the “doer” of the action, or, as it is customary to say, the “subject” of
which the action is predicated; or if, on the contrary, it is the end point, the “object” of
the action. If I wish to communicate an intelligible idea about a farmer, a duckling, 
and the act of killing, it is not enough to state the linguistic symbols for these concrete ideas
in any order, higgledy-piggledy, trusting that the hearer may construct some kind of a
relational pattern out of the general probabilities of the case. The fundamental syntactic
relations must be unambiguously expressed. I can afford to be silent on the subject of
time and place and number and of a host of other possible types of concepts, but I can
find no way of dodging the issue as to who is doing the killing. There is no known
language that can or does dodge it, any more than it succeeds in saying something
without the use of symbols for the concrete concepts.","basic vocabulary, conceptualization, basic level concepts"
Sapir1921,"We may now conveniently revise our first classification of concepts as expressed in
language and suggest the following scheme:

independent words or radical elements; involve no relation as such

*Derivational Concepts* (less concrete, as a rule, than I, more so than III): normally
expressed by affixing non-radical elements to radical elements or by inner modification
of these; differ from type I in defining ideas that are irrelevant to the proposition as a
whole but that give a radical element a particular increment of significance and that are
thus inherently related in a specific way to concepts of type I

*Concrete Relational Concepts* (still more abstract, yet not entirely devoid of a measure
of concreteness): normally expressed by affixing non-radical elements to radical
elements, but generally at a greater remove from these than is the case with elements of
type II, or by inner modification of radical elements; differ fundamentally from type II
in indicating or implying relations that transcend the particular word to which they are
immediately attached, thus leading over to

*Pure Relational Concepts* (purely abstract): normally expressed by affixing non-radical
elements to radical elements (in which case these concepts are frequently intertwined
with those of type III) or by their inner modification, by independent words, or by
position; serve to relate the concrete elements of the proposition to each other, thus
giving it definite syntactic form.","basic vocabulary, concepts, conceptualization"
Babych2016,"This paper presents a methodology for calculating a modified Levenshtein edit distance
between character strings, and applies it to the task of automated cognate identification from non-
parallel (comparable) corpora. This task is an important stage in developing MT systems and
bilingual dictionaries beyond the coverage of traditionally used aligned parallel corpora, which can
be used for finding translation equivalents for the ‘long tail’ in Zipfian distribution: low-frequency
and usually unambiguous lexical items in closely-related languages (many of those often under-
resourced). Graphonological Levenshtein edit distance relies on editing hierarchical
representations of phonological features for graphemes (graphonological representations) and
improves on phonological edit distance proposed for measuring dialectological variation.
Graphonological edit distance works directly with character strings and does not require an
intermediate stage of phonological transcription, exploiting the advantages of historical and
morphological principles of orthography, which are obscured if only phonetic principle is applied.
Difficulties associated with plain feature representations (unstructured feature sets or vectors) are
addressed by using linguistically-motivated feature hierarchy that restricts matching of lower-level
graphonological features when higher-level features are not matched. The paper presents an
evaluation of the graphonological edit distance in comparison with the traditional Levenshtein edit
distance from the perspective of its usefulness for the task of automated cognate identification. It
discusses the advantages of the proposed method, which can be used for morphology induction,
for robust transliteration across different alphabets (Latin, Cyrillic, Arabic, etc.) and robust
identification of words with non-standard or distorted spelling, e.g., in user-generated content on
the web such as posts on social media, blogs and comments. Software for calculating the modified

combination to create distinct words. Despite the central role that phonemic category contrasts
play in the transmission of information, they can be lost through language change. The nearly
century-old functional load hypothesis proposes that phoneme contrast loss is less likely the
greater the ‘work’ that a contrast does in distinguishing words. In Wedel, Kaplan, & Jackson,
under review, we showed that simple measures of functional load do significantly predict patterns
of phoneme merger, and that this effect is in the hypothesized direction: the greater the number
of minimal word pairs that a phoneme contrast distinguishes, the less likely is merger. Here, we
extend that analysis to two additional lexical properties predicted to influence the uncertainty
associated with minimal pairs. We present evidence that within our dataset, the number of
minimal lemma pairs sharing syntactic category better predicts merger than those with divergent
syntactic categories, and that the number of minimal lemma pairs with similar frequencies better
predicts merger than those with divergent frequencies. These findings support the general
variationist/usage-based/evolutionary research program, which assumes a causal chain linking
properties of individual utterances to long-term change in the abstract, sublexical category system

Nakassis2015,"The thesis of this essay is that linguistic anthropology is not the study of language. Rather, “language”
functions as a permanently problematic, if indispensable, object for linguistic anthropological analysis and thought.
This is because, as I suggest, the critical intervention of linguistic anthropology over the last 40 years has been
its ethnographic focus on indexicality, in particular, the ways that indexical processes undermine language as an
autonomous object, entangling it with other semiotic modalities and thereby displacing it beyond its putative borders.
Reviewing linguistic anthropological scholarship from 2015, I argue that it is the study of this displacement and its
more general semiotic implications—and the entangled and mutually informing analytics that have been developed
to theorize them, for example, language ideology, entextualization, interdiscursivity, chronotope—that centers the
field. Focusing on a set of such analytics, I illustrate how recent linguistic anthropological scholarship has elaborated
the reflexive, dialectical nature of social life, theorizing what I call total semiotic facts. I explore these dialectics by
discussing three thematic clusters that occupied the attention of the field in 2015: diversity and authenticity, political
economy, and mass mediation.","anthropology, linguistics, overview, history of science, "

metaphorical ideas like “grasping the explanation.” There is now abundant evidence that metaphors

diachronically from pronouns is by no means as self-evident as it may seem. Second, person indexation in
Tangut, the oldest Trans-Himalayan language with person indexation, is not optional, as has sometimes been

Grossman2015,"Language change is a central concern for any linguistic theory. For one thing, it is often assumed
that language change is explanatory, in that it provides a reasonable answer to what Haspelmath dubbed

answer is: ‘Because they became that way through processes of language change.’ However, this sort of
answer throws into focus the fact that language change is not only a potential explanation for language
structures. Rather, it is a set of problems that itself calls for explanation. In fact, this could be called
‘Greenberg’s Second Question’: why do languages change the way they do? In this article, we explore some
ways in which the field of experimental pragmatics might shed light on the second question, by providing a
set of methods that could investigate existing hypotheses about language change by developing falsifiable

According to this hypothesis, Proto-Indo-European and Proto-Uralic are

this hypothesis have run into numerous difficulties. One difficulty
concerns the inability to reconstruct the ancestral morphological system in

terms of borrowing rather than inheritance. Moreover, the lack of
agreement in vocabulary affects the ability to establish viable sound

show that these and other difficulties are caused, at least in large part, by
the question of the origins of the Indo-European parent language. Evidence

them. Most models of grammar account for regularity by hypothesising that there
is only a limited set of symbols for expressing underlying forms, and that an
independent grammar algorithm transforms symbol sequences into an output
representation. However, this explanation for regularity is called into question by
research which suggests that the mental lexicon records rich phonetic detail that
directly informs production. Given evidence for biases favouring previously ex-
perienced forms at many levels of production and perception, I argue that positive
feedback within a richly detailed lexicon can produce regularity over many cycles
of production and perception. Using simulation as a tool, I show that under the
influence of positive feedback, gradient biases in usage can convert an initially
gradient and variable distribution of lexical behaviours into a more categorical and
simpler pattern.","systemic processes, phonology, systematic aspect of evolution,"
Bowers2011,"Participants read aloud swear words, euphemisms of the swear words, and neutral stimuli while their autonomic activity was measured by electrodermal activity. The key finding was that autonomic responses to swear words were larger than to euphemisms and neutral stimuli. It is argued that the heightened response to swear words reflects a form of verbal conditioning in which the phonological form of the word is directly associated with an affective response. Euphemisms are effective because they replace the trigger (the offending word form) by another word form that expresses a similar idea. That is, word forms exert some control on affect and cognition in turn.

Here, we use independent component analysis to derive information theoretically optimal, non-redundant codes (filter populations) for seven typologically distinct languages (Dutch, English, Japanese, Marathi, Polish, Spanish and Turkish) and relate the statistical properties of these filter populations to documented differences in the speech rhythms (Analysis 1) and consonant inventories (Analysis 2) of these languages. We show that consonant class membership plays a particularly important role in shaping the statistical structure of speech in different languages, suggesting that acoustic transience, a property that discriminates consonant classes from one another, is highly relevant for efficient coding.","consonants, sound patterns, communicative efficiency, language acquisition"
Cocho2015,"Statistical studies of languages have focused on the rank-frequency distribution of words. Instead, we introduce here a measure of how word ranks change in time and call this distribution rank diversity. We calculate this diversity for books published in six European languages since 1800, and find that it follows a universal lognormal distribution. Based on the mean and standard deviation associated with the lognormal distribution, we define three different word regimes of languages: “heads” consist of words which almost do not change their rank in time, “bodies” are words of general use, while “tails” are comprised by context-specific words and vary their rank considerably in time. The heads and bodies reflect the size of language cores identified by linguists for basic communication. We propose a Gaussian random walk model which reproduces the rank variation of words in time and thus the diversity. Rank diversity of words can be understood as the result of random variations in rank, where the size of the variation depends on the rank itself. We find that the core size is similar for all languages studied.","rank frequencies, word frequency, lexical change, statistics, concept list"

From a set of known cognates, the method induces rules capturing regularities of orthographic mutations that a word undergoes when migrating from one language into the other. The rules are then applied as a preprocessing step before measuring the orthographic similarity between putative cognates. As a result, the method allows to achieve an improvement in the F-measure of 11,86 % in comparison with detecting cognates based only on the edit distance between them.

striking parallels between the evolution of life forms and the history of languages.
Starting from the rise of language studies as a scientiic discipline in the early 19 th

from both disciplines have repeatedly pointed to similarities between the respective
research objects in biology and linguistics. Of all these parallels, the use of family
trees to model the differentiation of species (genomes and languages) is surely the
most striking one. Methodically speaking, genealogical relations between lan-

Still, what our ancestors believed or thought or hoped about their own language, or the langauge of their ancestors or of their neighbors, about their differences and affinities, was important to them, not only were scholars interested in these questions: the thinking of the leading classes was also influenced by them, and also that of the peoples in general. It is true that the history of past science is largely the history of errors; but these errors -- even if they were errors, and they frequently are not -- still constitute the history of human thinking, and are therefore not alien to us.

List2016f,"This article investigates the terminology and the processes underlying the fundamental historical rela-
tions between words in linguistics (cognacy) and genes in biology (homology). The comparison
between linguistics and biology shows that there are major inconsistencies in the analogies drawn be-
tween the two research fields and the models applied in phylogenetic reconstruction in linguistics.
Cognacy between words is treated as a binary relation which is either present or not. Words, however,
can exhibit different degrees of cognacy which go beyond the distinction between orthologous and
paralogous genes in biology. The complex nature of cognacy has strong implications for the models
used for phylogenetic reconstruction. Instead of modeling lexical evolution as a process of cognate
gain and cognate loss, we need to go beyond the cognate relation and develop models which take the
degrees of cognacy into account. This opts for the use of evolutionary models which handle multistate
characters and allow to define potentially asymmetrical transition tendencies among the character
states instead of time-reversible binary state models in phylogenetic approaches. The benefit of multi-
state models with asymmetric transition tendencies is demonstrated by testing how well different
models of lexical change perform in semantic reconstruction on a lexicostatistical dataset of 23
Chinese dialects in a parsimony framework. The results show that the improved models largely out-
perform the popular gain–loss models. This suggests that improved models of lexical change may
have strong consequences for phylogenetic approaches in linguistics.","language model, cognacy, homology, Chinese dialects, lexical change, partial cognacy"
List2015d,"Little is known about the history of Chinese dialects. Major dialect groups were identified long ago using various
traditional criteria, such as tonal and segmental development from their presumed common ancestor; however,
scholarly agreement about their detailed development is largely lacking. At the core of the problem lies the role
that language contact played in the history of Chinese. Unlike in the case of other language families, the Chinese
dialects never really separated into distinct, independent languages, but kept evolving in close contact to each
other. As a result, it is hard to tell whether traits shared among the dialects have been inherited or borrowed. Recent
network approaches from a biological perspective could show a way out of this dilemma, since they were specifi-
cally designed to handle vertical and horizontal aspects in bacterial evolution, and the first pilot studies in histori-
cal linguistics have reported promising results. In this paper, a case study on the application of network approaches
in Chinese historical linguistics is presented. Based on a dataset of 200 basic items translated into 23 Chinese dia-
lect varieties, competing proposals for Chinese dialect classification are compared and tested for general plausibil-
ity. The results of the comparison show that network approaches are a useful supplement for quantitative and
qualitative approaches in Chinese historical linguistics. In order to reach their full potential, however, the underly-

Deng2014,"Systematic statistical analysis of the rhymes in the ""Book of Songs"" can help us summarize the types and rules for hyme containted therein. [...] One of the major problems in past phonological analysis was that rhyming theory was understood differently by different schlars. STudy of the rhyme contained in the Book of Songs is the first step in starting a discussion about the nature of rhyme. [...]

1. Book of Songs rhythm. [...] Wang Li's ""Shijing Yundu"" were in need of revision. [...]
2. Book of Songs Tongyun and Heyun. [...] It was found that that syllable tail harmony is the essential condition of Tongyun and Heyun.
3. Rhyming essentials. The similarities and differences of ""rhyme"" in ""rhyming"" and in ""phonology"" were analyzed. [...] Poems including ancient, modern, Chinese, and foreign were used to determine that the harmony of rhyme is derived speech perception system specific to each society. It was further shown that the nature of rhyme is ""harmony"" of syllable tail characteristics and that rhyme is the basis of ""yun"" (rhyme) in the field of phonology. Syllable tail characteristics  reflect the changes of a particular phonological system and are the key to the study of ancient Chinese rhyme.
4. Problems related to ancient Chinese rhyme sound construction. [...] The first is whether a rhyme class can have more than one vowel. [...] more than vowel is fundamental to sound consruction and is not antagonistic to single vowel constructions. [...] Second, the composition of sound in various constructions were analyzed. The sound composition used by several scholars was analyzed and the acceptance standard sued for ancient Chinese sound composition is discussed.
5. Ancient Chinese Yinsheng construction. A comparison between the Yinsheng and Rusheng rhyming pattern in the Book of Songs and the use of ""a"" in Tibetan literature. Use of rhyme in modern folk songs and the harmony of rhyme between elements were also taken into consideration. It is argued that syllables ending with vowel can rhyme with the syllables ending with stop coda. Therefore, there is no need to reconstruct a stop coda for Yinsheng rhyme groups.
6. Ancient Chinese tones. A commentary is made about which of three theories had the greates influence on the origin and development ancient Chinese tones: initial sound characteristic transfer, the length of the vowels and their elasticity, consonantts coda dissapearance. Statistical analysis of the Book of Songs rhyme material is used to reconstructed the tones of th eperiod of the Book of Songs as well as to deduce the evolution of ancient Chinese tones.","rhyme analysis, Old Chinese, Shījīng, rhyme patterns,"
Wang2010b,"Polysyllabic words in Chinese and Tibetan are the research object of this thesis. Their word-formation is re-classified according to the classification of word building and coinage.

Finally, the thesis probes into the feasibility of comparative study on word-formation of Chinese and Tibetan. It points out that word-formation which is very stable can be separated from grammar structure and there are some common features between Chinese and Tibetan in word-formation of polyseyllabic words, for example, monosyllabism, common compound word structure and syntactic structure. Besides, morphemes in both Chinese and Tibetan possess high independence and composability. the paper also compares the word-formation in Chinese and Tibetan with compounding, derivation, word reduplication and phonetic-based word formation in languages from other families so as to explore common features of polysyllabic words in Chinese and Tibetan from a wider perspective and provide some clues for the kin relationship of Sino-Tibetan family.","Sino-Tibetan, word formation, Tibetan, Chinese, polysyllabic words, morpheme"

Tsetkov2016,"Linguistic borrowing is the phenomenon of transferring linguistic constructions (lexical,
phonological, morphological, and syntactic) from a “donor” language to a “recipient” lan-
guage as a result of contacts between communities speaking different languages. Borrowed
words are found in all languages, and—in contrast to cognate relationships—borrowing
relationships may exist across unrelated languages (for example, about 40% of Swahili’s
vocabulary is borrowed from the unrelated language Arabic). In this work, we develop a
model of morpho-phonological transformations across languages. Its features are based
on universal constraints from Optimality Theory (OT), and we show that compared to
several standard—but linguistically more naïve—baselines, our OT-inspired model obtains
good performance at predicting donor forms from borrowed forms with only a few dozen
training examples, making this a cost-effective strategy for sharing lexical information
across languages. We demonstrate applications of the lexical borrowing model in machine
translation, using resource-rich donor language to obtain translations of out-of-vocabulary
loanwords in a lower resource language. Our framework obtains substantial improvements
(up to 1.6 BLEU) over standard baselines.","lexical borrowing, transducer, adaptation, automatic approach"

Interesting approach, especially since they use a four-stage pipeline which might be worth giving a look (although their approach is only bi-lingual, so no possibility to model borrowing in a larger scale of language history/evolution):

1. Pronunciation (convert alphabet to sounds)
2. Syllabification (extract syllable models, very good idea, indeed)
3. Phonological adaptation (very nice)
4. Morphological adaptation


They then use some methods to learn constraint weights and follow some OT scheme, but the main idea seems to be even more important.","optimality theory, loanword integration, lexical borrowing, adaptation, syllable structure"
Parkvall2008,"This paper presents an algorithm intended to quantify the diachronic stability of linguistic charac-

families is a stable feature. Conversely, a feature that correlates better with geographical areas than with
families is one that is sensitive to diffusion. Contrasting the structural heterogeneity within families with
that found within geographical areas, it is thus possible to make a statement regarding the varying
diachronic stability of specific features. While the main aim of the paper is methodological exploration,
and while the method certainly not devoid of problems, I propose that the current approach can be
useful in studies of language contact and long-range historical comparison.","stability, automatic approach, WALS, feature, grammatical feature, "

been the key tool for investigating linguistic prehistory. Textual records for languages are in
most parts of the world very recent, and even the earliest written records go back only a
shallow 5,000 years or so. Thus if we were entirely dependent on written records little
historical linguistics could be done on many languages and we would have no clear idea of
the inter-relationship and prehistory of even relatively shallow language families like Slavic
or Germanic. Fortunately, CM allows us to reach much greater time depths and reconstruct
ancestral languages that existed thousands of years before the advent of writing.","comparative method, methodology, historical linguistics, introduction"

Weiss2014,"If the regularity hypothesis is correct, then CM should in theory be universally applicable.
Nevertheless, there are many factors that can make the application of CM challenging or
virtually impossible. The most obvious limitation is the absence of comparative data.
Language isolates are not uncommon and only fairly shallow linguistic prehistories can be
discovered for them (see Campbell in press). To take the best known isolate, Basque does not
have an extensive linguistic prehistory since we are limited to the evidence of internal
reconstruction, and the examination of Latin loanwords.","regularity hypothesis, comparative method, universality"
Weiss2014,"The system reconstructed by CM, an entity bearing some relation to a prehistoric grammar,
should be subject to whatever constraints I-language is universally subject to. But the
evaluation of the typological plausibility of reconstructed systems has often been clouded by
confusion between those constraints that are truly features of the computational component
of the human genetic language endowment and those prevalent tendencies that result from
the diachronic fi lter. A case in point would be fi nal devoicing of obstruents. It is undeniable
that fi nal devoicing is a very widespread phenomenon, but is this because fi nal devoicing is
a realisation of some innate cognitive principle, e.g. the emergence of the unmarked in
positions of neutralisation, or is it because there are multiple phonetic factors conspiring to
prefer word-fi nal devoicing? If the former is the case then the fi nal voicing of obstruents
would be excluded and any reconstructed language with such a feature (like Proto-Indo-
European apparently where the evidence of Italic, Anatolian and Indic appears to point to the
generalisation of voiced stops in word-fi nal position) would require serious revision, for
example by reinterpreting the apparent voice feature as something more phonetically
plausible. On the other hand, if the explanation for the prevalence of fi nal devoicing is
phonetic bias, and if there are also possible diachronic pathways to fi nal voicing, then the
reconstruction of such an unusual phenomenon cannot be excluded.","evaluation, linguistic reconstruction, comparative method, "

Castro2015,"The Sui are an official minority group of China with a population of around 430,000. The Sui language
belongs to the Kam-Sui branch of the Tai-Kadai language family.
This research presents the results of a large-scale survey of the Sui language. The goals of the survey
were to document the Sui dialect situation and to elucidate the genetic and synchronic relationships
among the various dialects. A 600-item wordlist was collected from sixteen data points. Comprehension
of four Sui dialects was also tested across the region using Recorded Text Tests (RTTs).
Based on the primary data and on Thurgood’s (1988) Proto-Kam-Sui, and drawing on related
languages as well as various other reconstructions, this work first charts the historical development of
the Sui dialects. Secondly, it maps out dialect groups based on synchronic lexical similarity. Thirdly, it
applies Levenshtein distance analysis to the data and describes the resulting dialect groups. Finally, it
describes and discusses RTT methodology and results. The report also includes wordlist data, phonology
sketches for each data point, and interlinearised RTT texts.
The results show that Sui has four main dialects and that one of these is genetically more closely
affiliated to Kam than to Sui. Additionally, three dialects have low mutual intelligibility. Mutual
intelligibility of dialects is not completely predicted by genetic relationships.
Some items of particular interest in this work include: 1) evidence for sesquisyllabic words in Proto-
Kam-Sui (supporting Pittayaporn 2009); 2) evidence for the areal diffusion of tonal flip-flops (Yue-
Hashimoto 1986); and 3) an innovative L2 retelling method for testing inter-dialect intelligibility.

Chacon2015,"There has been much debate regarding the internal history of the Tukanoan languages dur-
ing the last four decades, with different classification proposals being based on lexical and
phonological data. Here, we present a new classification of the Tukanoan language family

posed sound change patterns. In contrast to traditional methods based on the manual identi-
fication of shared innovations by experts, our method identifies valid innovations within a
parsimony framework. In contrast to existing computational models which are mostly based
on binary character states for lexical data, we model sound change patterns as directed
weighted transitions between multiple character states. We apply the new approach to a set
of 21 extant Tukano languages. Our results confirm the east-west split of the Tukanoan lan-
guages which was proposed in the past and suggest a classification which groups Kubeo
with Tanimuka on the one hand, and Koreguahe with Maihiki, on the other hand, thus rec-
onciling previous classifications. We use this new classification to propose a consensus phy-

Chacon2015,"The common idea of subgrouping in classical historical lin-
guistics and subgrouping in cladistics is that only shared innovations can be used to identify a valid
clade. While this view is sound and just on the first sight, it is essentially circular for a couple of
reasons. First, the identification of innovations defining a given subgroup requires knowing what
was the ancestral state before the innovation occurred. This makes subgrouping vulnerable as it
depends on the criteria used for linguistic reconstruction, which can vary considerably from one
linguist to another even when dealing with the same sound correspondences. The most extreme
risk is for true innovations getting analyzed as retentions and vice-versa. The only way to circum-
vent the problem of circularity is to know the direction underlying the processes under investiga-
tion. Directionality is, however, only a necessary condition for the identification of shared innova-
tions, since it is likewise possible that directional process occur independently or are propagated
by horizontal transmission. Second, subgrouping may bear the risk of circularity if linguists em-
ploy sub-grouping hypotheses when doing their reconstructions, since, in common practice, many
linguists often have a certain tree topology in mind when refining their reconstructions. Third, [pb] many sound innovations do not occur only once in a well defined subset of languages. In fact,
the most common types of sound change have a greater probability to occur multiple times in
the evolutionary history of a linguistic family (homoplasy), not to mention cases of phonologi-
cal borrowing (lateral transfer). In many cases it is a priori impossible to say whether a sound
change is a “true” shared innovation (a singular evolutionary event) or an instance of inde-
pendent innovations (multiple evolutionary events). In order to separate the wheat from the
chaff, linguists need to distinguish which sound innovations are more reliable for subgroup-
ing than others. This introduces, however, a further problem, since sound changes which are
more reliable for subgrouping need to be rare. Rare sound changes, however, are difficult to
observe and study, and the risk that they are merely based on wrongly proposed cognate sets
or incorrectly interpreted assessments of directionality is very high (@Harrison2003). So no
matter what we do in traditional subgrouping, as long as we try to use shared innovations, we
are confronted with problems of circularity, epistemology, and objectivity.","phylogenetic reconstruction, genetic classification, circularity, subgrouping, sound change, shared innovation"
Wagner2010,"Identical rhymes (right/write, attire/retire) are considered satisfactory and even artistic in French poetry but are considered unsatisfactory in English. This has been a consistent generalization over the course of centuries, a surprising fact given that other aspects of poetic form in French were happily applied in English. This paper puts forward the hypothesis that this difference is not merely one of poetic tradition, but is grounded in the distinct ways in which information-structure affects prosody in the two languages. A study of rhyme usage in poetry and a perception experiment confirm that native speakers' intuitions about rhyming in the two languages indeed differ, and a further perception experiment supports the hypothesis that this fact is due to a constraint on prosody that is active in English but not in French. The findings suggest that certain forms of artistic expression in poetry are influenced, and even constrained, by more general properties of a language.","poetry, perception, rhymes, information structure, English, French"

Kaan2008,"**BACKGROUND:**

Tone languages such as Thai and Mandarin Chinese use differences in fundamental frequency (F0, pitch) to distinguish lexical meaning. Previous behavioral studies have shown that native speakers of a non-tone language have difficulty discriminating among tone contrasts and are sensitive to different F0 dimensions than speakers of a tone language. The aim of the present ERP study was to investigate the effect of language background and training on the non-attentive processing of lexical tones. EEG was recorded from 12 adult native speakers of Mandarin Chinese, 12 native speakers of American English, and 11 Thai speakers while they were watching a movie and were presented with multiple tokens of low-falling, mid-level and high-rising Thai lexical tones. High-rising or low-falling tokens were presented as deviants among mid-level standard tokens, and vice versa. EEG data and data from a behavioral discrimination task were collected before and after a two-day perceptual categorization training task.


**RESULTS:**

Behavioral discrimination improved after training in both the Chinese and the English groups. Low-falling tone deviants versus standards elicited a mismatch negativity (MMN) in all language groups. Before, but not after training, the English speakers showed a larger MMN compared to the Chinese, even though English speakers performed worst in the behavioral tasks. The MMN was followed by a late negativity, which became smaller with improved discrimination. The High-rising deviants versus standards elicited a late negativity, which was left-lateralized only in the English and Chinese groups.

**CONCLUSION:**

Results showed that native speakers of English, Chinese and Thai recruited largely similar mechanisms when non-attentively processing Thai lexical tones. However, native Thai speakers differed from the Chinese and English speakers with respect to the processing of late F0 contour differences (high-rising versus mid-level tones). In addition, native speakers of a non-tone language (English) were initially more sensitive to F0 onset differences (low-falling versus mid-level contrast), which was suppressed as a result of training. This result converges with results from previous behavioral studies and supports the view that attentive as well as non-attentive processing of F0 contrasts is affected by language background, but is malleable even in adult learners.","tone, perception, Thai, Mandarin, English"
Hoth2016,"The Freiburg speech intelligibility test according to DIN 45621 was introduced around 60 years ago. For decades, and still today, the Freiburg test has been a standard whose relevance extends far beyond pure audiometry. It is used primarily to determine the speech perception threshold (based on two-digit numbers) and the ability to discriminate speech at suprathreshold presentation levels (based on monosyllabic nouns). Moreover, it is a measure of the degree of disability, the requirement for and success of technical hearing aids (auxiliaries directives), and the compensation for disability and handicap (Königstein recommendation). In differential audiological diagnostics, the Freiburg test contributes to the distinction between low- and high-frequency hearing loss, as well as to identification of conductive, sensory, neural, and central disorders. Currently, the phonemic and perceptual balance of the monosyllabic test lists is subject to critical discussions. Obvious deficiencies exist for testing speech recognition in noise. In this respect, alternatives such as sentence or rhyme tests in closed-answer inventories are discussed.","speech norms, naming test, audiometry, listening comprehension, "
Pilling2004,"Native speakers of two languages (English and Ndonga) were compared on three colour cognition tasks (sorting, triads and visual search) in a test of the linguistic relativity hypothesis (Whorf, 1956). The colour lexicons of these two languages differ because Ndonga has no basic terms for ORANGE, PINK and PURPLE, and stimuli were chosen to exploit this difference. On the sorting task (sorting into similarity-groups) for each language, nominally similar colours were grouped together more often than nominally dissimilar colours. On the triads task (choosing the most different of three colours), when the most nominally isolated colour differed for the two language-groups, each group tended to choose their nominal isolate. On the search task (scanning for target colours among distractors), targets were either in a different English category than distractors (cross-category), or some distractors were in the same English category as distractors (within-category). The 'cost' in speed of having within-category distractors was much greater for the English than for the Ndonga. Overall, these data suggest that a core universal component is modulated by a small relativist influence. The differences in the visual search task are consistent with language affecting pre-attentive processes (an indirect language effect) as well as exerting on-line influences (a direct effect).","linguistic relativity, color terms, English, Sapir-Whorff hypothesis, Ndonga"

textual defamiliarizing effects, and their functional and perceptual consequences. By
referring both to Victor Shklovsky’s psychological concept of ostranenie and
Jakobson’s model of language functions, special attention is paid to the location of
emotions in poetic texts. Given this background, specific factors of communication

Ciaccio2015,"The theory postulating that language shapes the way we perceive reality,
mostly known as Linguistic Relativity or Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis, has been widely
debated in the past years. In particular, an increasing number of studies have dealt
with the relationship between color naming and color perception, this being more
easily observable than other rather abstract language categories. While some research
on this field provided evidence for language effects on color perception, others
stressed cross-linguistic universal tendencies in color naming and perception.
Although supporters of the two main approaches have struggled to establish their
theories rejecting the opposite view for many years, a new reconciling approach
between them seems to emerge in more recent literature. On the one hand, this
position would acknowledge the existence of universal tendencies in color naming.
At the same time, it would posit that there can also be differences in the way
languages encode color boundaries, and that these differences may, in turn, affect
color perception. As a result, the two views not only seem compatible, but even
complementary. According to this interpretation, the present paper aims at providing
a review on the recent literature concerning color naming and color perception.","linguistic relativity, Sapir-Whorff hypothesis, color terms, relativism, universalism"
VanDriem2007,"In mediaeval Europe, most scholars came to terms with the world’s linguistic
diversity within the framework of a Biblical belief system. Even at the end of the
eighteenth century, pious scholars such as Sir William Jones believed that the myth of
the Tower of Babel explained how ‘the language of Noah’ had been ‘lost irretrievably’
(1793: 489). Another Biblical view attempted to explain the world’s linguistic stocks as
deriving from Noah’s three sons after the deluge had abated in the well-known
Judæo-Christian myth of the ark. The descendants of Shem populated the earth with
Semitic speaking peoples, whereas the descendants of Ham today spoke ‘Scythian’
languages, whilst all other languages derived from the progeny of Noah’s eldest son
Japhet.

The Semitic languages most notably include Hebrew, the language of the Old
Testament. The Semitic language family is known today as Afroasiatic. Scythian or
‘Scythisch’ is a language family first identified in Leiden by Marcus van Boxhorn
(1647), although van Boxhorn did not invoke Biblical mythology in any of his own
writings. His theory of language relationship was renamed Indo-Germanic or

ethnography in the Soviet Union for decades was Marrism. This school of thought

VanDriem2007,"A third monophyletic view of Asian linguistics stocks is the most interesting
because, though it has been whittled down in the course of time, this model still exists
today and includes Chinese. The Indo-Chinese theory was invented by John Caspar
Leyden, a Scottish physician and poet who died at the age of 35 in Batavia in the Dutch
East Indies. He travelled widely in India and in mainland and insular Southeast Asia.
His Indo-Chinese family encompassed all the languages ‘of the regions which lie
between India and China, and the greater part of the islanders in the eastern sea’, which
although ‘dissimilar’, according to Leyden, ‘exhibit the same mixed origin’ (1806: 1).
Leyden did not live long enough to publicly disavow the theory, as Müller had done for
Turanian, and Indo-Chinese was to doggedly lead a life of its own, even though it was
constantly under assault by more knowledgeable scholars. Indo-Chinese is known today
as ‘Sino-Tibetan’.","Sino-Tibetan, history of science, genetic classification"
Heine2016,"Building on recent findings made in the framework of Construction Grammar,
on the one hand, and within the framework on grammaticalization, on the other,
the present paper is concerned with the development from lexical compound-
ing to derivation. Compounding is presumably the most common source of
derivational categories and this applies in particular to modifying (endocentric)
compounds, which are the main subject of this paper. By looking at three cases
of grammatical change in English, German, and the West African language Ewe
it is argued that the two frameworks differ in their goals and in their approaches.
Both frameworks search for regularities in grammatical change, but whereas
Construction Grammar has a focus on constructional change, that is, change
in the development of constructions, the central question asked by students of
grammaticalization is how and why, e.g., lexical categories give rise to grammati-
cal (or functional) categories.","compounding, construction grammar, word derivation, word formation, grammaticalization"
Plebe2015,"The idea that language molds our thinking has met with varying degrees of favor in the history of philosophy and linguistics. A rather puzzling aspect of this debate is the lack of rigorous demonstration or rebuttal of the language-thought connection. We believe that one obstacle is the intrinsic difficulty in treating “thought” as a measurable dependent variable in empirical, replicable, experiments. We plead the case for a more humble, but more verifiable, aspect of linguistic relativity: by looking at cases where language shapes our perception, instead of  “thought” generally. We target the domain of color terms, a field where the effects of language in shaping perception have been more striking, even if the details are highly debated, and also discuss a different kind of perception, one related to emotion terms. We argue that in this case, there is also a continuum in the proprioceptive determinants of emotions, which is structured into discrete categories by language.","linguistic relativity, Sapir-Whorff hypothesis, relativism, universality"
Kao2011,"What makes a poem beautiful? To answer this question, this thesis uses computa-
tional methods to examine stylistic and content features employed by professional
and amateur poets. I propose and test the hypotheses below: (1) Beautiful poems
contain more sophisticated diction and poetic sound devices (2) Beautiful poems
are more emotional (3) Beautiful poems contain more concrete details and imagery.
Building upon existing techniques designed to quantitatively analyze poetic style and
sentiment in texts, I identify and analyze factors testing these hypotheses. Results
showed no significant difference between the difficulty levels of professional and am-
ateur poets’ vocabulary. Contrary to prediction, professional poets use significantly
less sound devices such as rhyme and alliteration than amateur poets. Professional
poems were also found to contain significantly fewer emotional words than amateur
poems. The most important mark of good poetry was instead concrete and specific
imagery. Professional poets refer to specific objects more often and employ a greater
variety of words. This suggests that professional poets are able to evoke sentiment
using concrete and specific imagery instead of abstract or explicitly emotional words.
These results challenge and confirm several established doctrines in creative writing
and poetic theory, suggesting that methods from computational linguistics may help
support the analysis of beauty in verbal art.","poetry, poetic function, computer-based approaches, rhyme patterns, English"

Agha2015,"It may not be an exaggeration to say that our understanding of linguistic
and other forms of human communication has advanced more during
the 20th century than in any preceding period. Yet these changes did not
occur all at once. Instead, different levels of organization within communi-
cative conduct became focal objects of scholarly attention at different times.
Earlier in the 20th century, research paradigms in many disciplines were
dominated by approaches that favored abstract models of homogenous sign
systems underlying the complexities of situated communication. A trans-
formative shift began after the middle of the century, when scholarship be-
gan to turn from abstractable models to contextual and perspectival varia-
tion, from an exclusive focus on langue, defined as the object of linguistics
by Ferdinand de Saussure (1857–1913), to the organization of parole into
forms of situated language use within social practices. Attention to situated
practices soon revealed that many features of parole rely on the tendency
of language users to adapt the resources of langue in heterogeneous ways
within specific varieties of communicative conduct. “Register” originated as
a term to designate these varieties.

In recent decades, approaches to register phenomena have become central
to many disciplines in Europe and North America. The present volume brings
together work by anthropologists, folklorists, linguists, and philologists. The
sixteen articles collected here represent approaches that have developed on
both sides of the Atlantic. Many authors discuss the development of register
studies in their own fields and employ analytic techniques developed within
distinct disciplinary traditions. They focus on the register organization of a
range of semiotic devices – whether grammatical units or prosody, whether
lexical items or melodic contours, whether verbal signs or kinesic behaviors,
whether spoken as utterances or circulated through script-artifacts. They
describe models of communicative conduct in a variety of social practices
and historical locales, and the range of phenomena they describe is far wider
than those studied in early approaches to registers.","register, synchronic variation, language variation, "

subject salience is determined by regions outside BA44 supporting the perceptual salience of people within
a scene; (b) the ability to process ‘non-canonical’ structures (i.e., structures with a non-default mapping
between syntax and semantics) may have been crucial in the evolution of language, and (c) that constituent

that in addition to a large number of atonal languages, the tone languages of the region are actually far
more diverse than usually assumed, and employ phonation type contrasts at least as often as pitch. Along
the same lines, we argue that concepts such as tone and register, while descriptively useful, can obscure
important underlying similarities and impede our understanding of the behavior of phonetic properties,
typological regularities, and diachrony. We finally draw the reader’s attention to some issues of current

unary primes, use is made of head–dependency relations. The central motivation for switching from a binary

Mendes2016,"Substitution rates are known to be variable among genes, chromosomes, species, and lineages due to multifarious biological processes. Here, we consider another source of substitution rate variation due to a technical bias associated with gene tree discordance. Discordance has been found to be rampant in genome-wide data sets, often due to incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). This apparent substitution rate variation is caused when substitutions that occur on discordant gene trees are analyzed in the context of a single, fixed species tree. Such substitutions have to be resolved by proposing multiple substitutions on the species tree, and we therefore refer to this phenomenon as Substitutions Produced by ILS (SPILS). We use simulations to demonstrate that SPILS has a larger effect with increasing levels of ILS, and on trees with larger numbers of taxa. Specific branches of the species trees are consistently, but erroneously, inferred to be longer or shorter, and we show that these branches can be predicted based on discordant tree topologies. Moreover, we observe that fixing a species tree topology when performing tests of positive selection increases the false positive rate, particularly for genes whose discordant topologies are most affected by SPILS. Finally, we use data from multiple Drosophila species to show that SPILS can be detected in nature. Although the effects of SPILS are modest per gene, it has the potential to affect substitution rate variation whenever high levels of ILS are present, particularly in rapid radiations. The problems outlined here have implications for character mapping of any type of trait, and for any biological process that causes discordance. We discuss possible solutions to these problems, and areas in which they are likely to have caused faulty inferences of convergence and accelerated evolution.

members than to the remainder of the network. In this
paper, we characterize as a function of size the statistical
and structural properties of such sets of nodes. We define
the network community profile plot, which characterizes the
“best” possible community—according to the conductance
measure—over a wide range of size scales, and we study
over 70 large sparse real-world networks taken from a wide
range of application domains. Our results suggest a signifi-
cantly more refined picture of community structure in large
real-world networks than has been appreciated previously.
Our most striking finding is that in nearly every network
dataset we examined, we observe tight but almost trivial
communities at very small scales, and at larger size scales,
the best possible communities gradually “blend in” with the
rest of the network and thus become less “community-like.”
This behavior is not explained, even at a qualitative level,
by any of the commonly-used network generation models.
Moreover, this behavior is exactly the opposite of what one
would expect based on experience with and intuition from
expander graphs, from graphs that are well-embeddable in
a low-dimensional structure, and from small social networks

borrowing from a foreign language, then it is surely quite an interesting

Sampson2015,"Recent cross-language research has yielded strong statistical evidence in
support of the idea, advocated by André Martinet and widely accepted by
linguists, that languages avoid adopting sound-changes which would
create many homophones. Yet we know that the history of Chinese
phonology has been marked by repeated phoneme mergers and losses
which led to a very high incidence of homophony, forcing the
monomorphemic vocabulary of the classical language to be replaced by a
largely bimorphemic modern vocabulary. This paper examines various
ways in which this apparent contradiction might be resolved. None seems
fully satisfactory, yet some resolution must exist.","splits and mergers, phoneme merger, Chinese, language history, syllable structure, monosyllabicity, Old Chinese,"
Sampson2015,"One of the most striking properties of Chinese, to people more
familiar with European languages, is its very high incidence of
homophony. All languages contain some homophones, for instance
English /rait/ can represent any of the unrelated words right, write, or rite.
But in English and other European languages, words which coincide in
pronunciation with other words are a minority, and even in such cases it is
rare for more than two or three etymologically-distinct words to share a
spoken form. In Chinese, and particularly in the standard, Mandarin
dialect, if for the moment we use the term “word” to refer to 字 rather
than to 詞, there are very few words which are not homophonous with
other words, and a set of homophones may contain ten or twenty
members.","homophony, Mandarin, Chinese, Chinese dialects"
Sampson2015,"It is difficult to be precise about which of all the words that
have been used in the long recorded history of Chinese should be counted
as elements of present-day spoken Mandarin, but one linguistically-
sophisticated attempt to do so is Chao and Yang (1962); on average a
Mandarin syllable is ambiguous between about four of the 字 listed there,
with a maximum of 25-way homophony for the syllable yù.","homophony, Chinese, Mandarin"
Sampson2015,"Studies initiated in Qing-dynasty China have shown that this
situation results from a series of sound-changes over a long period which
merged phonemes that previously contrasted, or eliminated phonemes
altogether (merged them with zero).","Chinese, homophony, language history"
Sampson2015,"In general linguistics, though, there is a longstanding belief that
the historical sound-changes which occur in all languages are subject to a
constraint by which they avoid creating a high degree of homophony.

pairs of words distinguished by that particular contrast.","phoneme merger, sound change, language change, sound change, "

evidence is discussed by Wedel, Kaplan, and Jackson (2013), who examine
41 phoneme mergers in six European languages together with Korean and
Cantonese, all of which occurred recently enough to allow vocabularies to
be studied statistically. Comparing phoneme mergers which have actually
occurred with hypothetical mergers that are equally phonetically plausible
but have not occurred, Wedel et al. find support at a very high level of
significance (p < .001) for the hypothesis that the likelihood of a merger
correlates inversely with the number of homophones it creates.","functional load, sound change, phoneme merger, quantitative analysis"
Sampson2015,"As things stand, then, we have arguments which seem quite cogent
that language-change avoids creating excessive homophony; if I did not
know about Chinese I would certainly find those arguments convincing.
Yet at the same time we know that sound-changes in the history of
Chinese have created a massive level of homophony. This is a real
paradox. Both statements appear to be true, but they contradict each other.
The aim of the rest of this paper is to explore various ways in which one
might hope to resolve the paradox. None of the alternatives seems to me
satisfactory. But some resolution there must be.","functional load, phoneme merger, Chinese, paradox"

Behr2015,"One point made by Professor Sampson, which cannot be emphasized
too much given the rampant back-projection of Standard Mandarin syllable

greater than in modern European languages.” (p.2.) [@Sampson2015 ]

","Chinese, Old Chinese, homophony, sound change, phoneme merger"
Behr2015,"Taking tonality into account, Middle Chinese still had
more than 3000 distinct syllables (Duanmu 1999), i.e. about as much as
the 2.756 distinct CVC syllables regularly used in Modern English
(Barker 2008). In short, the necessity of distinguishing lost distinctions of
the spoken language in writing must have been low well down to the
medieval period and it is therefore inherently unlikely that
disyllabification is exclusively driven by functional considerations of
homophony avoidance.","Middle Chinese, homophony, statistics, Guǎngyùn, rhyme books, phoneme inventory"
Behr2015,"The process of disyllabification is to a large degree concomitant to
the rise of tonal distinctions in Old and Early Medieval Chinese, only
completed shortly before the Suí reunification in the peripheral dialects
(Pulleyblank 1973). The compensatory function of replacing lost final and
laryngeal distinctions in the segmental inventory by phonemic tones is
curiously absent from Professor Sampson's consideration of solutions for
the apparent “enigma”. This is somewhat surprising in view of the fact
that Shannon entropy inspired theories of “functional (FL) load as
information loss” (@Hockett<1966> 1966, Wang 1967) clearly show that the FL of
tonal distinctions is much higher than that of stress in non-tonal
languages and about as high as the FL of vowels in a tone-language like
Mandarin (Surendran & Niyogi 2003: 16). In other words, capacities for
lexical distinction in perception and communication arising from such FL
patterns, rely heavily on tonal distinctions.","functional load, tonogenesis, tone language, statistics"
Behr2015,"It has recently been shown on the basis of a quantitative analysis of
the development of Written Tibetan – a language phonotactically very
close to pre-tonal reconstructed OC – into its various modern tonal and
non-tonal dialect descendants, that there is a clearly identifiably threshold
when the rate of segmental homophony invariably gives rise to
disambiguating tonal contrasts. Although the employed method is
somewhat crude, calculating the degree of homophonicity as the number
of single syllables divided by the number of syllables with distinct initials [pb]
and finals – 1, it clearly shows a tendency, whereby a homonym rate
between 2.5 and 3.0 correlates with the incidence of phonemic tone
distinctions in a successor dialect (Kǒng Jiāngpíng 2012). Any solution of
the “enigma” will therefore have to carefully take tonal distinctions
across the lexicon into account.","homophony, Written Tibetan, Tibetan, phoneme merger, tonogenesis"

Again, I would caution here against two
assumptions which could seem to be implied, namely (a) that all such
cases of internally unanalyzable compounds are loanwords, and (b) that
the number of disyllabic words in Old Chinese is truly neglectable, [...].



More importantly, it has become increasingly clear during recent
years that the process of disyllabification of the vocabulary must have
started already in the oracle bone period.
Although much depends on the
notoriously difficult definitions of “wordhood” in this area, some
scholars estimate the percentage of compounds as high as one quarter of
the vocabulary.

","polysyllabic words, Old Chinese, monosyllabicity, sound change, homophony"
Behr2015,"A recent metastudy of disyllabicity in 27 early and medieval
corpora of excavated texts and in the edited literature (Zhèng Zhènfēng &
Lǐ Dōnggē 2010) clearly shows the following trends, directly relevant to
the discussion of homophony avoidance as a compensatory mechanism:
(a) disyllabification was incipient long before the phonological changes
which eliminated most OC initial consonant clusters and the process of
tonogenesis. 
In pre-Qín paleographic materials, rates of disyllables start
out with ca. 20% in OBI, reach a first peak in Chūnqiū 春秋 bronze in-
scriptions at 27.8%, and a second one in late Warring States and Qín
bamboo strip inscriptions (Bǎoshān 包山: 43.8%, Shuìhǔdì 睡虎地:
43.5%).
The development is not strictly linear but apparently strongly
dependent on the sociolinguistic layer and textual genre. The great
“explosion” of disyllabicity, if seen from the perspective of excavated
materials, happens in the Eastern Hàn period, when all corpora start to
exceed rates of 50% of disyllabic compounds, reaching as high as 78.2%
for a corpus of stone and clay inscriptions from non-literary backgrounds.
[...]
(b) disyllabification rates are roughly comparable between excavated
texts and the edited literature, and, if anything, higher in the paleographic
materials which tend to reflect the underlying colloquial better due to a
lack of editorial “streamlining”.","polysyllabic words, sound change, Chinese, language history, Old Chinese, statistics"

subsequent recreation of polysyllables are an East and Southeast Asian
areal phenomenon (for a recent comprehensive overview see Michaud
2012; for the varying degrees of homophonicity in Chinese dialects see
Ke, Wang and Coupé 2002), it may well be that the rise of disyllables was
also consolidated by areal pressures.","linguistic area, South-East Asian languages, polysyllabic words, phoneme merger, sound change, language contact"
Behr2015,"(c) The idea that the rise of disyllabic words in documents is an artifact
contingent upon the availability of paper as a cheap writing support,
available roughly since the Eastern Hàn period, has been effectively
disproven. The rate of compounding is largely independent of the type of
the writing support. Theories, according to which disyllabicity arose early
on but was only reflected in texts much later due material constraints are
therefore unconvincing.","Chinese, polysyllabic words, language change, "
Chen2015,"1. The massive homophony in modern Chinese was the result of multiple
sound changes, including nasal ending mergers, final consonant loss,
devoicing, palatalization (hence the neutralization between k,kh,x and ts,
tsh, s), and so forth — processes that need not happen all at once. It is
entirely conceivable that, for instance, nasal merger took place at time x,
creating pressure for disambiguation by means of compounding at time y,
which in turn facilitates devoicing at time z, and so forth.","Chinese, phoneme merger, polysyllabic words, language change"

One barrier to interdisciplinary research is the widespread perception that interdisciplinary projects are less likely to be funded than those with a narrower focus3, 4. However, this commonly held belief has been difficult to evaluate objectively, partly because of lack of a comparable, quantitative measure of degree of interdisciplinarity that can be applied to funding application data1. Here we compare the degree to which research proposals span disparate fields by using a biodiversity metric that captures the relative representation of different fields (balance) and their degree of difference (disparity). The Australian Research Council’s Discovery Programme provides an ideal test case, because a single annual nationwide competitive grants scheme covers fundamental research in all disciplines, including arts, humanities and sciences. Using data on all 18,476 proposals submitted to the scheme over 5 consecutive years, including successful and unsuccessful applications, we show that the greater the degree of interdisciplinarity, the lower the probability of being funded. The negative impact of interdisciplinarity is significant even when number of collaborators, primary research field and type of institution are taken into account. This is the first broad-scale quantitative assessment of success rates of interdisciplinary research proposals. The interdisciplinary distance metric allows efficient evaluation of trends in research funding, and could be used to identify proposals that require assessment strategies appropriate to interdisciplinary research5.","interdisciplinary research, chances, funding"

which distributional properties of words are causal factors in semantic
change. Several independent contributing factors are identified. First, the
degree of prototypicality of a word within its semantic cluster correlated
inversely with its likelihood of change (the “Diachronic Prototypicality
Effect”). Second, the word class assignment of a word correlates with its rate
of change: verbs change more than nouns, and nouns change more than
adjectives (the “Diachronic Word Class Effect”), which we propose may be
the diachronic result of an independently established synchronic
psycholinguistic effect (the “Verb Mutability Effect”). Third, we found that
mere token frequency does not play a significant role in the likelihood of a
word’s meaning to change. A regression analysis shows that these effects
complement each other, and together, cover a significant amount of the
variance in the data.","semantic change, automatic approach, directionality, part of speech, prototypicality"

1995) in that we consider linguistic phenomena to be systematic and partly arbitrary,
but so closely tied to cognitive and social factors as not to be self-contained; they
are therefore in part nonarbitrary. One of the linguist’s tasks is to determine what is
arbitrary, what is not, and how to account for the differences.

We see semantic change (change in code) as arising out of the pragmatic uses to
which speakers or writers and addressees or readers put language, and most espe-
cially out of the preferred strategies that speakers/writers use in communicating with
addressees. The changes discussed in this book are tendencies that are remarkably
widely attested, but that can be violated under particular, often social, circumstances
ranging from shifts in ideological values to the development of various technolo-
gies. “Regularity” is to be understood as typical change, or frequent replication
across time and across languages, not as analogous to the Neogrammarian idea of
unexceptionless change in phonology.

has often been assumed that changes in words’ meanings are due to a tendency
for languages to avoid ambiguous form-meaning pairings, such as homonymy,
synonymy, and polysemy (@Anttila<1989> 1989; Menner 1945).","systemic processes, homophony, synonyms, semantic change"

Zhu2015,"Before proceeding, we need to define or explain some terms. First,
the “tonotype,” a new concept in phonology and typology, is characterized
by three features: (1) Each tonotype has its own defining acoustic and/or
perceptual property/ies; (2) Any tonotype would contrast with another (or
more) of the same contour type in at least one language; and (3) A tonotype
inventory is a set of types which is adequate and least redundant in
describing and defining all contour tones in all tonal languages.","tonotype, distinctive features, language model, typology, definition"
Zhu2015,"This paper started with criticizing two old schemes of tonal
representation and ends with endorsing a new one. The new one, the RLM,
is adequate for describing and representing 1,400 tonal systems in the
author’s audio database and can predict later tonal development through [pb]
observance of synchronic variations. The data used in this paper are
different from those in previous similar papers’ in four aspects: 1)
acoustic data; 2) multi tokens/speakers; 3) typological comparability
owing to the same normalization procedure; and 4) verifiability.

Having excluded the LoT, which contains various low contours,
including the lowest falling pitch, a universal falling inventory has been
constructed which contains eleven Falling Tonotypes, seven in the M
Register and four in the L Register. These tonotypes are expressed in the
RLM and specified with five distinctive features, which incorporates four
tonal parameters: register, length, height, and contour. It is likely, of
course, that more falling types would be discovered in the future and the
system might be adjusted; however, the present classification has paved
the way for future typological and evolutionary studies.","tonotype, cross-linguistic study, distinctive features, tone, complex tone languages"

/52/, corresponds to many FPS forms, such as [51, 52, 53, 41], etc. (cf. §§3.2,

case of falling tones, the FPS can define ten types of straight falling tones:
[51, 52, 53, 41, 42, 31; 54, 43, 32, 21], thirteen delayed falling tones such as
[551, 552, 331, 431...], seventeen depressed falling tones such as [451, 342,

Kaplan2015,"Several recent papers (Silverman 2010; Kaplan 2011; Wedel et
al. 2013a,b) have presented evidence in favor of the longstanding
functional load hypothesis (Martinet 1952; @Hockett<1967> 1967), arguing that
phoneme pairs that distinguish many words are unlikely to undergo
merger, and that this phenomenon can be detected in sufficiently large
datasets. In contrast with some other approaches (e.g., @King<1967> 1967), these
recent studies assume that functional load operates as a statistical
tendency: homophony avoidance is one factor among many that
influences the course of sound change, and does not by itself predict
whether a given pair of sounds will merge or not.","functional load, Chinese, statistics, tendencies"
Kaplan2015," @Wedel2013 

In this context, it is quite clear that the Chinese case is indeed an
outlier. Sampson estimates that the merger of /k k h x/ with /ts ts h s/, for
example, may have resulted in as many as ten thousand homophones.
Even if we suppose that Sampson’s estimate is two or three times too
large, we are still left with a merger that produced an order of magnitude
more homophones than any of the actual mergers in Wedel et al. (2013b).
We would predict that mergers of this type ought to be vanishingly rare.","Chinese, phoneme merger, functional load, statistics"
Kaplan2015,"More plausible to
me, though still far from certain, is the suggestion that one of the mergers
Sampson describes was sufficient to trigger systematic compounding, and
those compounds effectively eliminated many minimal pairs and allowed
subsequent mergers to proceed. Given a scenario along these lines, the
‘trigger’ merger would remain unexplained, but we could understand why
so many unusual mergers have occurred in a single language.","compounding, phoneme merger, Chinese, functional load"
Kaplan2015,"But if we systematically
dismiss apparent counterexamples to the functional load hypothesis, we run
the risk of making the hypothesis unfalsifiable. Indeed, now that the basic
case for functional load has been made, a clear and necessary direction for
ongoing research is to find and study examples like Chinese, in order to
refine our understanding of the generality of functional load and its
interaction with other influences on language change.","functional load, Chinese, litmus test, hypothesis, "
Wedel2013,"For nearly a century, linguists have suggested that diachronic merger is less likely between
phonemes with a high functional load – that is, phonemes that distinguish many words in
the language in question. However, limitations in data and computational power have
made assessing this hypothesis difficult. Here we present the first larger-scale study of
the functional load hypothesis, using data from sound changes in a diverse set of languages.
Our results support the functional load hypothesis: phoneme pairs undergoing merger dis-
tinguish significantly fewer minimal pairs in the lexicon than unmerged phoneme pairs.
Furthermore, we show that higher phoneme probability is positively correlated with mer-
ger, but that this effect is stronger for phonemes that distinguish no minimal pairs. Finally,
within our dataset we find that minimal pair count and phoneme probability better predict
merger than change in system entropy at the lexical or phoneme level.","functional load, quantitative analysis, phoneme merger, statistics"

phonemes do significantly predict patterns of phoneme
merger, and that this effect is in the hypothesized direc-
tion: the greater the contribution a pair of phonemes
makes to word differentiation, the less likely those pho-
nemes are to merge over the course of language change.
Further, we show that in the case that a phoneme pair does
not distinguish many words, phoneme probability is a sig-

Koskenniemi2013,"Regular correspondences between historically related languages can be modelled using finite-
state transducers (FST). A new method is presented by demonstrating it with a bidirectional
experiment between Finnish and Estonian. An artificial representation (resembling a proto-
language) is established between two related languages. This representation, AFE (Aligned
Finnish-Estonian) is based on the letter by letter alignment of the two languages and uses
mechanically constructed morphophonemes which represent the corresponding characters. By
describing the constraints of this AFE using two-level rules, one may construct useful mappings
between the languages. In this way, the badly ambiguous FSTs from Finnish and Estonian to
AFE can be composed into a practically unambiguous transducer from Finnish to Estonian. The
inverse mapping from Estonian to Finnish is mildly ambiguous. Steps according to the proposed
method could be repeated as such with dialectal or older written texts. Choosing a set of model
words, aligning them, recording the mechanical correspondences and designing rules for the
constraints could be done with a limited effort. For the purposes of indexing and searching, the
mild ambiguity may be tolerable as such. The ambiguity can be further reduced by composing
the resulting FST with a speller or morphological analyser of the standard language.","sound correspondences, sequence alignment, finite state transducer, automatic approach"

Wang2016,"In Chinese some personal pronouns and demonstrative pronouns share the same origins because of the conceptual cognitive mappings existing bewteen the personal domain and demonstrative pronound omain.

Therefore, the second personal pronoun *er* (尓) evolves into *na* (那), and the vacancy of the  third personal pronoun can only be filled in with other pronouns which have nothing to do with proximal or distal demonstrative ronouns. Because of the mental distance of the referent of the third person concept and the historically later appearance of K series of distal demonstrative pronouns in the southeast dialects, the pronouns of the ""otehr demonstrative"" type *ta* (他) and *qi* (其) of specific reference similar in sound to the N series and the K series evolve into the third personal pronouns in the two categories of dialects. The concept of the third personal pronoun in northwest dialects corresponds to that of proximal deixis and distal deixis, and because its referent is mentally far, the distal demonstrative pronoun *wu/na* (兀/那) is used for the third personal pronoun as well.

Zeng2015,"In this paper the present-day pronunciations of the historically voiced
obstruents in Xiangxiang Chinese were examined from an acoustic-phonetic perspective. Results strongly supported an ongoing process of
devoicing for the voiced stops, fricatives and affricates, which is
conditioned by a couple of factors including sex of speaker, place of
articulation, manner of articulation and historically tonal type.
Specifically, historically voiced obstruents in syllables corresponding to
the historical tone category Ru have all become voiceless unaspirated or
voiceless aspirated, meaning the process of devoicing has already
completed; in contrast, for those that occur in syllables corresponding to
the other three tonal categories, i.e., Ping, Shang, and Qu, i) the historical
devoicing is still in progress, as evidenced by a considerable amount of
intra- and inter-speaker free variation in the pattern of voicing among
“fully voiced”, “partially devoiced” and “fully devoiced” obstruents; ii)
the degree of devoicing is the highest in voiced fricatives, followed by the
voiced affricates, and is the lowest in voiced stops; and iii) the devoicing
also tends to be more extensive for obstruents with a more posterior place
of articulation, and for male than female speakers. Candidate
explanations for these patterns of devoicing were also presented.","voicing, Chinese dialects, devoicing, sound change, Xiāng"
Zeng2015,"Interesting article on experimental phonetics, where devoicing patterns in synchrony in a Xiāng dialect are investigated. Apparently, devoicing patterns differ regarding sex but also regarding place of articulation. Furthermore, devoicing was already completed in the rù-tone category of Middle Chinese. Place of articulation apparently follows the oral cavity, with least amount of devoiced stops in [b] via [d] and [g], with similar patterns for fricatives.","speech acoustics, experimental phonetics, devoicing, Xiāng, Chinese dialects"
Zeng2015,"However, the data found in Xiangxiang dialect showed that,
although both of the above factors had an effect on the occurrence of
voicing/devoicing, only place of articulation exhibited the predicted pattern.
On one hand, the occurrence of devoicing for the voiced stops increased as
the point of occlusion moved further back in the oral cavity: 32% for [b], [pb]
41% for [d] and 55% for [g]. The voiced fricatives, which distinguish two
major places of articulation (velar [:sampa:`G`] vs. alveolar/post-alveolar [z zj]),
exhibited the predicted pattern as well, [:sampa:`G`] having a higher percentage
number of devoiced tokens than the three anterior consonants. On the other
hand, there was a larger proportion of devoiced stops in male speakers in
comparison to female speakers: 55% of the voiced stops, 97% of the voiced
fricatives and 69% of the voiced affricates were devoiced in male speakers,
in comparison with 24% of devoiced stops, 84% of devoiced fricatives and
59% of devoiced affricates in female speakers.","devoicing, experimental phonetics, Chinese dialects, Xiāng"
Zeng2015,"It was also found that historical tonal category was closely related
with devoicing in the Xiangxiang dialect. The historically voiced
obstruents have all become voiceless unaspirated or voiceless aspirated in
syllables corresponding to the historical tone category Ru (entering),
while devoicing is still in progress for those in syllables corresponding to
the other three historical tonal categories, i.e., Ping (level), Shang (rising),
and, Qu (departing), as evidenced by the observation made in the present
study that there is a considerable amount of intra- and inter-speaker free [pb]
variation in the pattern of voicing among “fully voiced”, “partially
devoiced” and “fully devoiced” obstruents. In fact, many other Chinese
dialects, the Old Xiang dialects in particular (Chen 陳 2008), also
exhibited a similar pattern that devoicing occurred first in historical Ru
syllables. To address this, another historical process with regard to the
development of the historical Ru tone should also be taken into
consideration -- it is widely attested across Chinese dialects that the
historical Ru tone has ceased to be an independent tonal category but has
been redistributed among other tones.","sound change, rù-tone, Chinese dialects, Xiāng"
Zeng2015,"the development of the historical Ru tone, which is
characterized by its (C)VC syllable structure in which the syllable-final
“C” can be [p], [t] or [k], consisted of at least two steps. At the first stage,
the syllable-final [p t k] was weakened and became a glottal stop [ :sampa:`?` ], as
evidenced by many dialects in current Wu dialects and Jianghuai dialects [...] where historical Ru is still an
independent tonal category and preserves its (C)VC structure, but the
final stops have all become [ :sampa:`?` ].

Then this glottal stop dropped and the
preceding vowel was lengthened, and it is at this point that Ru began to
merge into other tones. The observation in the Xiangxiang dialect that
devoicing occurred first in historically Ru-tone syllables indicated that
devoicing may occur prior to the redistribution of this historical tonal
category, or, at least, when its independent status was still retained to
some extent. If this is not the case, or in other words, if the historical Ru
tone already merged into other tones before devoicing took place, the
attested sensitivity of devoicing to this tonal category cannot be explained.","rù-tone, devoicing, Middle Chinese, sound change, Xiāng"
Zeng2015,"Another well-known
consonant type that has an effect on vowel pitch is voiced obstruents
(voiced stops being discussed the most), that is, prevocalic voiced stops
would lower the F 0 of the following vowel. These two consonant types
were inherently incompatible and exerted contradictory effects on the pitch
of the intervening vowel, therefore making it difficult for speakers to
produce a historically Ru-tone syllable which begins with a voiced
obstruent and is checked by a glottal stop (let’s assume that devoicing had
not taken place by the time the three stop finals merged into [ :sampa:`?` ]). Moreover,
the short vowel duration for the Ru-tone syllables would make these two
effects more overlapping and therefore more incompatible with each other,
which would further enhance the already-existing pronunciation difficulties.","Chinese dialects, devoicing, rù-tone, Xiāng"
Nesetril2012,"This text is aimed at doctoral students and researchers, who are interested in
Combinatorics and Graph Theory or who would just like to learn about some
active topics and trends. But the book may be also interesting to researchers
in mathematics, physics, chemistry, computer science, etc. who would seek for
an introduction to the tools available for analysis of the properties of discrete
structures, and sparse structures particularly. The dichotomy between sparse
and dense objects is one of the main paradigm of the whole mathematics
which transcends boundaries of particular disciplines. This is also reflected
by our book.

The book is organized in three parts, called Presentation, Theory, and
Applications.

The first part, Presentation, gives a general overview of the covered mate-
rial and of its relationships with other domains of contemporary mathematics
and computer science. In particular, Chap. 2 is devoted to the exposition of
some typical examples illustrating the scope of this book.

The second part, Theory, is the largest part of the book and it is divided
into eleven chapters. Chapter 3 introduces all the relevant notions and results
which will be used in the book: basic notions and standard terminology, as
well as more involved concepts and constructions (such as homomorphisms,
minors, expanders, Ramsey theory, logic, or complexity classes), or more
specific considerations on graph parameters, structures, and homomorphism
counting. Chapter 4 introduces the specific notions used to study the density
properties, shallow minors, shallow topological minors, or shallow im-
mersions of individual graphs, as well as the related fundamental stability
results. These results are applied in Chap. 5, and this leads to the nowhere
dense/somewhere dense classification and to the notion of classes with
bounded expansion (which are sparser than general nowhere dense classes).
This classification is very robust and it can be characterized by virtually
all main combinatorial invariants. Several first characterizations are included
in Chap. 5, and more characterizations are given in Chaps. 7, 8, 12, and 11.
Chapter 5 ends with a discussion about the connection to model theory and
the various approaches to handle general relational structures. Although the
study of dense graphs frequently relies on the properties of dense homoge-
neous core structures (like complete graphs or even random graphs), it will
be shown that sparse graph properties are intimately related to the proper-
ties of trees, and particularly to the ones of bounded height trees. Funda-
mental results on bounded height trees and, more generally, on graphs with
bounded tree-depth are proved in Chap. 6. They open the way to the main
decomposition theorem, which is the subject of Chap. 7. The decomposition
scheme introduced there, which we call low tree-depth coloring, is a deep
generalization of the concept of proper coloring. The low tree-depth colorings
also lead to an alternative characterization of the nowhere dense/somewhere
dense dichotomy. Yet another characterization of this dichotomy is proved
in Chap. 8, that relies on the notion of independence through the notion of
quasi-wideness (which has been introduced in the context of mathemati-
cal logic). Chapters 9 and 11 deal with homomorphism dualities. Bounded
expansion classes are proved to have the richest spectrum of finite dualities
and, in the oriented case, they are actually characterized by this property.
Meanwhile, Chap. 10 establishes a connection to model theory and deals par-
ticularly with relativizations of the homomorphism preservation theorem of
first-order logic. A last characterization of the somewhere dense/nowhere
dense dichotomy is proved in Chap. 12 by considering the asymptotic loga-
rithmic density of a fixed pattern in the shallow minors of the graph of a
class. In a sense, one can view this last result as a characterization of the di-
chotomy in probabilistic terms. The Theory part ends with Chap. 13 where
the results of the previous chapters are gathered and put to service in the
study of the characteristics of nowhere dense classes, of classes with bounded
expansion, and of classes with bounded tree-depth (which are derived from
trees with bounded height). It is pleasing to see how these characterizations
are nicely related.

The third part, Applications, concerns both theoretical and algorith-
mic applications of the concepts and results introduced in the second part.
This part opens with Chap. 14 which gives several examples of classes with
bounded expansion, such as classical classes defined in the context of ge-
ometric graphs and graph drawing, as well as classes admitting bounded
non-repetitive colorings. It is also the occasion for a connection with the
Erdős-Rényi model of random graphs. Some applications are considered in
Chap. 15, such as the existence of linear matching (and more generally unions
of long disjoint paths), connection with the Burr-Erdős conjecture, with game
coloring, and with spectral graph theory. In Chap. 16, the use of a density driven criterion for the existence of sublinear vertex separators links our study
to the sparse model of property testing, via the concept of hyperfiniteness.

We provide in Chap. 17 core algorithms related to our study. In particular,
we detail a fast iterative algorithm to compute a low tree-depth decompo-
sition, the number of colors being controlled by a polynomial dependence
on the densities of the shallow minors of the graph. The fact that this algo-
rithm is nearly linear for sparse classes is one of the main advantages of our
approaches. In Chap. 18 we consider algorithmic applications, which mainly
derive from the fast low tree-depth coloring algorithm. These cover various
well-known algorithmic problems, such as subgraph isomorphism, decidabil-
ity of first-order properties, as well as their counting versions.

The title of the last chapter—Further Directions—is self-explanatory.

Thomason2007,"Historical linguists have always known that some linguistic changes result from deliberate,
conscious actions by speakers. 1 But the general assumption has been that such changes are
relatively trivial, confined mainly to the invention or borrowing of new words, changes in lexical
semantics, and the adoption of a few structural features from a prestige dialect. The goal of this
paper is to show that adult speakers can and do make deliberate choices that bring about nontrivial
lexical and structural linguistic change; I also discuss some of the implications of the most extreme
examples for historical linguistic methodology. Although such processes are not confined to
contact-induced change, the focus here is on processes motivated at least in part by language
contact. The particular categories that I’ll focus on are correspondence rules applied in lexical
borrowing, deliberate non-change, and deliberate structural change. Perhaps the most important
lesson to be learned from examples of deliberate change and deliberate non-change is that efforts to
develop deterministic predictive theories of contact-induced change – either by setting theoretical
limits on its extent or by predicting specific outcomes under specific linguistic and/or social
conditions – are doomed; but I won’t explore this point in detail in the present paper (see Thomason
2000 for discussion of the general issue).","language change, language contact, deliberate change, "
Thomason2007,"The Comparative Method is by far the most powerful
tool in the historical linguist’s toolbox. It dates from the 1870s in essentially its modern form,
though of course we know much more about the mechanics and results of language change now
than we did a hundred years ago. Because it enables us to reconstruct sizable portions of proto-
language lexicon, phonology, and morphology, and to a lesser extent (morpho)syntax as well, the
Comparative Method greatly expands our ability to examine language changes over considerable
time depths. If our knowledge of language change were confined to actually attested past changes
and the very recent studies of ongoing change, our understanding of processes and probabilities of
change would be based on evidence from a tiny handful of languages in a tiny handful of language
families – primarily, at present, languages that have been documented for several hundred years or
more. And our understanding would be extremely impoverished in comparison with what we
actually do know, thanks primarily to the Comparative Method.

Most significantly, then, the Comparative Method provides us with a window on prehistory.
Historical linguistics is not unique among the historical sciences in being able to recover specific
information that is not directly attested, from a period before any direct attestations are available;
but it is certainly one of the most successful historical sciences in this regard. Certain other
historical sciences, for instance paleoanthropology, have borrowed and adapted our Comparative
Method in efforts to achieve comparable results. It is true, of course, that the time depths reached by
the Comparative Method – perhaps 10,000 years, possibly a bit more – are very shallow compared
to the relevant time depths for historical sciences such as evolutionary biology. Still, we are envied
by many other historical scientists for our ability to trace linguistic features back into prehistory.
The body of information about language families and their proto-languages, including the paths and
results of a huge number of phonological and morphological changes, enables us to make fairly
confident statements about common vs. uncommon changes, if not about possible vs. impossible
changes.","time depth, comparative method, definition"
Thomason2007,"If asked what kinds of linguistic changes speakers are most likely to make deliberately, most
linguists would think first of lexical innovations. Every generation of teenagers has its own slang
vocabulary and every specialized field has its own technical lexicon, to take the most obvious
examples. So, for instance, a few generations ago the word crazy took on a slang meaning ‘terrific,
wonderful’ – a lexical semantic innovation, added to its earlier meaning ‘insane’ – and around 1960,
college students in California replaced crazy in its slang meaning with napa, derived from the
location of a state mental institution. Still later, another generation replaced crazy (and, in
California, napa) with cool.","deliberate change, language change, lexical change"
Thomason2007,"Finally, although the Comparative Method has worked very well for the great majority of
languages around the world to which it has been applied, the method fails, and can in fact be
predicted to fail, in cases where speakers’ choices do have a drastic effect on a language’s lexicon
and grammar. Unfortunately for historical linguists’ hopes of elucidating language history, such
cases can be impossible to unravel retrospectively – except, of course, that we can identify a given
language as having had an aberrant history, because the Comparative Method itself alerts us to that
fact. Fortunately for our hopes, however, the number of areas in the world where speakers have
chosen to make such drastic changes is small, and even within those areas the situation is usually
not completely hopeless.","comparative method, deliberate change, limitations"
Mufwene2007,"Publications such as Thomason & Kaufman (1988) and Thomason (2001, 2002) have perpetuated,
without fundamental support, the distinction between internally- and externally-motivated language
changes. They suggest that the two kinds of changes are different in nature and that those induced
by language contact have not contributed to language speciation in the same way as those owing
(principally) to language-internal mechanisms. Putatively, genetic classifications should be based
only on correspondences suggested by internally-motivated change. Thus, they conclude that
creoles cannot be classed genetically, because, in their case, contact was so extensive that the
comparative method cannot be applied to them in informative ways. This disjoint view of language
diversification, which has treated creoles as children out of wedlock (Mufwene 1997b, 2001), is so
deeply entrenched in linguistics that it is repeated both in general introductions to linguistics and in
historical linguistics textbooks. When the latter kinds of books cover the development of creoles at
all as part of their subject matters, they also claim that these vernaculars are genetically
“exceptional,” if not unnatural, because they have not emerged in the “usual” and/or “natural” way.
See, e.g. Hock & Joseph (1996, critiqued in Mufwene 1998, 2001).","creolisation, creole languages, comparative method, methodology"
Mufwene2007,"Adducing arguments from external history, I argue in this article that the above problem stems
from a misinterpretation of the genetic Stammbaum (or cladogram) as an account of language
diversification rather than as a representation of the outcome of the speciation process. The problem
also comes from a basic assumption in genetic linguistics, since the design of the Stammbaum by
August Schleicher in the 19 th century, that normal language diversification proceeds monoparentally
(a process identified by biologists as “asexual transmission”).","family tree, problem, critics, diversification, speciation"
Mufwene2007,"I submit that the whole distinction between internally versus externally-motivated change must
have to do with another legacy from the 19 th century: the ideology of language purity, which is itself
related to that of race purity. According to this, hybrids, products of race or language mixing, are
less normal, if not simply, abnormal phenomena (Mufwene, to appear). It is therefore not surprising
that creoles and pidgins, as putatively extreme cases of externally-motivated change, have typically
been suggested to be unnatural developments, even by creolists (e.g. McWhorter 2000, 2001, 2005).","purification, linguistic purism, racism, family tree, "
Mufwene2007,"If creoles have really
developed in their own unusual or abnormal way, their different structures suggest that the
ecologies of their emergence are far from being identical from one to the other. On the other hand,
if we assume a uniformitarian position and acknowledge that they have emerged by the same
restructuring processes that have often resulted in language diversification, then it is normal that
differing ecologies will produce new mutually divergent language varieties, even if exactly the
same languages are involved in the contacts. Local dynamics of competition and selection will
favor different variants even from what may appear to be more or less the same feature pools. Thus, [pb]
creoles are not genetically unusual, nor abnormal, nor less natural. Instead, they are a precious
opportunity for linguists to realize the extent to which language contact, subsuming also dialect
contact but really based on idiolect contact, has been a critical catalyst in language change and
speciation.","creolisation, creole languages, family tree, methodology, "
Mufwene2007,"To the extent that contact, situated at the idiolectal level, is acknowledged as a critical ecological
factor in the actuation of change, the distinction between externally and internally-motivated change
becomes simply sociological, and the distinction between changes induced by contact and those
independent of contact becomes misguided. Moreover, like evolutionary biology, genetic linguistics
(which could also be called evolutionary linguistics) has everything to gain from being interested in
issues of language vitality, which can then deal with the demise of languages by structural erosion
or by language shift and with the emergence of new varieties. In all these cases of language
evolution, the action of competition and selection among competing variants and/or systems is
evident.","internal and external sound change, sound change, language change, explanation of language change, contact-induced language change"

In formal contexts, in which there is attention to proper language, educated speakers filter out features which are not part of the standard language.

Jacques2011b,"Naxi, Na and Laze are three languages whose position within Sino-Tibetan is
controversial. We propose that they are descended from a common ancestor
(‘Proto-Naish’). Unlike conservative languages of the family, such as Rgyalrong
and Tibetan, which have consonant clusters and final consonants, Naxi, Na
and Laze share a simple syllabic structure (consonant+glide+vowel+tone) due
to phonological erosion. This raises the issue of how the regular phonological
correspondences between these three languages should be interpreted, and what
phonological structure should be reconstructed for Proto-Naish. The regularities
revealed by comparing the three languages are interpreted in light of potential
cognates in conservative languages. This brings out numerous cases of phonetic
conditioning of vowels by place of articulation of a preceding consonant or
consonant cluster. Overall, these findings warrant a relatively optimistic conclu-

path in the satellite. This study shows that modern Cantonese and Mandarin tend to express path in the satellite,
and specifically in the directional complement. Scholars suggest that Chinese has undergone a typological shift
from a verb-framed language to a satellite- framed language and the shift was completed at around the tenth cen-

twentieth centuries in Cantonese and Mandarin, this study observes that early Cantonese and Mandarin tend to
use directional verbs to denote path when their modern counterparts opt for the use of directional complements.

McDermott2016,"Music is present in every culture, but the degree to which it is shaped by biology remains debated. One widely discussed phenomenon is that some combinations of notes are perceived by Westerners as pleasant, or consonant, whereas others are perceived as unpleasant, or dissonant1. The contrast between consonance and dissonance is central to Western music, 3, and its origins have fascinated scholars since the ancient Greeks. Aesthetic responses to consonance are commonly assumed by scientists to have biological roots and thus to be universally present in humans. Ethnomusicologists and composers, in contrast, have argued that consonance is a creation of Western musical culture6. The issue has remained unresolved, partly because little is known about the extent of cross-cultural variation in consonance preferences. Here we report experiments with the Tsimane’—a native Amazonian society with minimal exposure to Western culture—and comparison populations in Bolivia and the United States that varied in exposure to Western music. Participants rated the pleasantness of sounds. Despite exhibiting Western-like discrimination abilities and Western-like aesthetic responses to familiar sounds and acoustic roughness, the Tsimane’ rated consonant and dissonant chords and vocal harmonies as equally pleasant. By contrast, Bolivian city- and town-dwellers exhibited significant preferences for consonance, albeit to a lesser degree than US residents. The results indicate that consonance preferences can be absent in cultures sufficiently isolated from Western music, and are thus unlikely to reflect innate biases or exposure to harmonic natural sounds. The observed variation in preferences is presumably determined by exposure to musical harmony, suggesting that culture has a dominant role in shaping aesthetic responses to music.","music, cultural evolution, cultural variation, perception"

Zheng2015,"Norman (1979) proposes there are three strata dated from the Qin-Han,
Southern dynasties and Late Tang period in the modern Min dialects

strata also exist in the Wu dialects. Most of the previous studies focus on
the comparison between the Southern Wu (SW) and Min and neglect the
materials of Northern Wu (NW). Through comparative studies, strata
analyses and referring to Chinese historical phonology, we assume that
some phonological traits in NW, SW and Min all come from Qieyun or the
Jiangdong dialect in the Southern dynasty. This paper also points out that
although Wu dialects in southern Zhèjāng are more similar to Min than
Northern Wu, such places in NW as Dānyáng, Chángshú and
“Chóngqīhǎi” near Jinling geographically regarded as the center of the

Southern dynasties, which is also similar to modern SW and Min.","Chinese dialects, Wú, Mǐn, language history, historical phonology, sound change, genetic relationship"

dramatically over time along with the consolidation of a tetrasyllabic line standard.

Behr2005,"One major problem in comparing RBI data to the tonal distributions encountered
in the Odes, 18 which have been meticulously analyzed by Cheung (1968), Jeon (1987),
Xiàng (1987) and others, is the almost complete lack of a concept of zhāng 章 or
stanza in rhyming bronze inscriptions. As is abundantly clear from the excavated
tomb text literature, the zhāng, rather than the whole poem, was the most important unit
of textual organization in the various bamboo strip versions of the Odes, but no similar
graphic, metric or conceptual entity is known from the bronzes.","stanza, rhyme patterns, poem, Bronze inscriptions, structure, "
Behr2005,"Moreovoer, it follows from the lack of stanzaic verse organization, that neither the
traditional fourway subdivision of tonally mixed sequences according to the number
tones involved within one rhyming sequence, nor an assignment of tonally mixed
sequences to one predominant tone (within the stanza!) is possible with regard to
rhyming bronze inscriptions. Even worse, it is well known that instances of nonadjacent
rhyming lines (i.e. ABAB, ABBA, ABACAB, ABACABC etc.) with or without one or
several intervening non-rhyming lines (i.e. A[...X...] B[...X...]B A[...X...] etc.) are much
more common in rhyming bronze inscriptions than in the Shījīng, 21 so that an approach
which simply takes an ""yī yùn dào dǐ"" 一韻到底 or unchanged monorhyme sequence as
the domain of reference for tonal patterns is clearly not feasable.","Bronze inscriptions, rhyme patterns, Old Chinese"

Ratcliffe2012,"The high degree of contradiction and incompatibility between two indepen-
dently produced Afroasiatic comparative lexica (Ehret 1995, Orel & Stolbova
1995) calls into question the reliability of the comparative method at deep time
depths. The discrepancy could only have arisen if one or both sources contain
a large number of chance or spurious matches. This article first documents the
discrepancy between the two comparative lexica, and then attempts to explain it.
The central proposal is that the evaluation of a proposed reconstruction must go
beyond qualitative evaluations of individual proposed cognate sets and incor-
porate quantitative tools for evaluating the probable degree of chance matches
within the reconstruction as a whole.","reliability, validity, comparative method, methodology, Afroasiatic languages, long-range comparison"
Ratcliffe2012,"One way to test the reliability of the comparative method would be to under-
take the following experiment. Take a set of languages for which a relationship
has been suggested, but for which regular sound correspondences and a recon-
structed proto-language sound system have not yet been established. Furnish two
libraries in different places with all the available and relevant information on the
languages (dictionaries, grammars, texts). Take two teams of researchers trained
in the comparative method, put them in the libraries, keep them in isolation from
each other and see what they come up with. If it is a reliable procedure then two
trained practitioners of it confronted with the same body of data should come up
with broadly similar results — repeatability of experiments might reasonably be
expected, as in natural science. Of course, finding qualified volunteers for such an
experiment might prove quite difficult.","comparative method, reliability, validity, methodology, inter-annotator agreement"
Ratcliffe2012,"Therefore, even when there is no direct contradic-
tion, proposals of cognacy in one source which crucially rely upon assumptions
about sound correspondences, root-structure, or semantics which are contradic-
tory with the assumptions about these matters made by the other source must
be judged incompatible in principle.
By this criterion I have judged that about
555 of Ehret’s (1995) entries, more than half the total, as incompatible with the
Afroasiatic reconstruction of Orel & Stolbova (1995). In short the two sources
have reconstructed mutually unrecognizable proto-languages.","comparative method, testing, reliability, methodology, linguistic reconstruction"

Ratcliffe2012,"In what follows I will present the results of my comparison of the two lexica,
and then show how probabilistic tools can be used to evaluate and explain the dis-
crepancy between them. I will consider how to calculate in principle the relative
costs (in terms of raised expectation of chance matches) of different ways of con-
ducting a comparison. I will also attempt to determine how allowing for leeway in
different areas may vary the number of chance matches. Finally I will show how it
might be possible to estimate the expected number of chance matches likely to be
present in a proposed set of reconstructions, based on what the researcher making
the proposal reveals about the method of conducting the search.","linguistic reconstruction, comparative method, statistics, reliability, methodology"
Ratcliffe2012,"In the following discussion I will use the term “Agreeing” to describe cases
where both sources agree in connecting a particular word in one branch with a
particular word in at least one other.

[pb]

The term “Complementary” describes two cases. The first is where connections
are proposed between words not treated by the other source, but where these pro-
posals are not incompatible in principle.

[pb]

The term “Contradictory” defines cases where both sources treat the same word in
one branch but connect it with a different words or internally non-cognate words
in another branch [...].


","evaluation, reliability, linguistic reconstruction, comparative method"
Ratcliffe2012,"There are three different causes of incompatibility between the sources: incompat-
ible sound correspondences, incompatible assumptions about root structure, and
incompatible assumptions about semantics. [...]

If a cognate set depends upon a sound correspondence contradictory with the
sound correspondences proposed in the other source it is IIP. 

[...] [pb]

That still leaves 17 proposed correspondence sets (= proposed reconstructed
segments) in Ehret (1995) and 14 in Orel & Stolbova (1995).  [...]

[pb]

Both Ehret (1995) and Orel & Stolbova (1995) allow 2-to-3 matches, that is cases
where a word with two consonants in one language is proposed as cognate with a
word with three consonants in another. However, the justification for this is differ-
ent in each case. Orel & Stolbova (1995) allow for the loss of certain consonants,
notably sonorants and gutturals (velar fricatives and post-velar consonants), in
all environments, and allow for a small number of consonants to be treated as [pb] fossilized prefixes or suffixes. Ehret takes the more radical view that all third con-
sonants are fossilized suffixes. [...] 

The category of semantically incompatible includes two types of problems, first
for a word with many meanings or many translation equivalents, the sources may
choose to take different ones as basic and search other languages accordingly.
[...]

The second problem, not unconnected with the first, is that the authors have
different assumptions about what sort of vocabulary to reconstruct for the proto-
language. As this example also illustrates, Ehret has tendency to reconstruct verbs
wherever possible, while Orel & Stolbova (1995) prefer concrete nouns.  



","incompatibility, linguistic reconstruction, evaluation, comparative method, reliability"
Ratcliffe2012,"Thus slightly less than seven percent of the cognate sets proposed by Ehret
(1995) are also proposed by Orel & Stolbova (1995). Slightly more than anoth-
er 21% are complementary. From the reverse perspective, since Orel & Stolbova
(1995) have roughly two and a half times as many entries as Ehret (1995), only
a little more than two percent of the cognate sets proposed by Orel & Stolbova
(1995) are also acknowledged by Ehret (1995). Die-hard opponents of long-dis-
tance comparison may leap to the conclusion that the method is 93% to 98% inac-
curate even at medium depths, but such a conclusion would be premature. Still,
the fact remains that two sets of scholars have been able to reconstruct mutu-
ally unrecognizable proto-languages, and this demands an explanation.","linguistic reconstruction, reliability, testing, evaluation, comparative method"

have made before they have found anything. But often this can be deduced from
the results. One interesting cause and effect relation is that broad semantic leeway

Ratcliffe2012,"This can be illustrated by example. Suppose one compares the word for ‘bird’
in one language not only with the equivalent for ‘bird’ in the other language, but
with the words for ‘sparrow’, ‘pigeon’, ‘vulture’, etc. If there are 50 “bird-words” in
each language, and one compares each of these in one language with the fifty in the
other, there is a total of 2500 (50 x 50) comparisons made. Of course if one finds [pb]
apparent cognates on the basis of assuming semantic equivalence between pairs like
‘swallow’~‘hawk’, ‘parrot’~‘quail’, ‘kite’~‘ostrich’, ‘butterfly’~‘pelican’, etc. one can only
reconstruct a superordinate term like ‘bird’ or ‘kind of bird’. If several such matches
are found, the researcher ends up reconstructing several synonyms for ‘bird’.
 
This example may sound exaggerated, but in fact it seems to be exactly what
Orel & Stolbova (1995) have done in this particular case. The index under ‘bird’
indicates 52 sets reconstructed with the meaning ‘bird’. This includes proposed
cognate sets with the following meanings.

[...]
However it is not plausible that Afroasiatic had 52 synonyms for the generic
term ‘bird’ and that these later differentiated in the individual languages. Natural
languages do not allow such a high degree of synonymy. The reconstruction of
synonyms is an artefact of method — specifically of allowing broad semantic lee-
way in making comparisons.","chance resemblance, linguistic reconstruction, cross-semantic cognates, methodology"
Ratcliffe2012,"Another way to increase the number of comparisons, in effect another way
to broaden semantic leeway, is to ignore derivational and etymological history.
If one considers not just the most basic or etymologically oldest sense of a word
but secondary semantic shifts, dialect variant meanings, derived words no longer
closely semantically connected with the source, etc., one can increase the number
of comparisons, and hence the degree of randomness. Conversely, a careful use of
etymological and derivational history to restrict the number of comparisons can
reduce the degree of randomness.","chance resemblance, morphological change, word derivation, methodology, comparative method, reliability"
Ratcliffe2012,"Comparison across branches in the absence of intermediate node reconstruction [...] allows for a choice of potential cognates among
many languages of a given sub-branch, increasing the number of comparisons and
hence the degree of randomness. The solution is, of course, more attention to re-
construction at the small family and sub-branch level. 
Of course, it is sometimes
the case that a peripheral language within a sub-group retains a conservative form,
while the majority of the languages in the sub-group have innovated together.
Reconstruction purely on the basis of the internal information of the sub-group
would probably lead us to reconstruct the majority (innovative) form and to ig-
nore the actually conservative peripheral form in these cases. This is a consequence
which simply has to be accepted in the preliminary stages of comparison, in the
same way that the Neogrammarian principle of regular sound change will initially
force us to ignore some legitimate cognates, for example place names or personal
names, which have not changed according to the regular sound laws.

[...] [pb]

Panchronic use of sources [...] leads to
an increase in the number of comparisons that can be made. [...] [pb]

Reconstruction of excessive synonyms and homonyms is generally considered
inconsistent with best practice. Presumably this reflects uniformitarian assump-
tions about what sort of thing is possible in actual languages. For functional rea-
sons a language can only tolerate a certain amount of synonymy and homonymy,
since homonymy creates ambiguity, which interferes with communication, and
synonymy, which is a form of redundancy, imposes unneccesary burdens on
memory. However, exactly how much synonymy and homonymy languages toler-
ate has never been systematically studied cross-linguistically, and it is difficult to
see how this even could be done, although Krupa (1968) presents an interesting
attempt to quantify synonymy for one language, Maori.

* use of data from many languages of a single sub-branch without reconstructing at the sub-branch level
* panchronic use of the sources, choosing meanings from various time depths
* broad semantic reconstruction

The author compares two reconstructions on Afro-Asiatic languages and comes to the conclusion that they largely differ, thus showing that the comparative method does not work at the deep level, due to the methodological looseness, as illustrated by the three points mentioned above, which increase the number of chance resemblances.","comparative method, stochastic analysis, chance resemblance, methodology, linguistic reconstruction"
Kaiping2016,"Theoretical anthropology tries to develop models of human biology and culture. In
this thesis, we investigate how different computational models from theoretical biology
can be applied to evolutionary anthropology. We study two different types of models,
applying them to two different sub-fields of evolutionary anthropology, and highlighting
alternative choices in their construction.

On the one hand, we observe that the evolutionary simulations are composed of three
main components: an updating rule, a game and a population structure. We find that
the updating rule can alter the qualitative and quantitative evolutionary outcome of a
model. A dominant language is more resilient to learning errors and more frequent when
selection primarily weeds out maladapted individuals, instead of promoting well-adapted
ones.

We study the evolution of cooperation and institutional punishment. Group selection
can support cooperation, even when implemented through the selection of individual
agents migrating between communities at different rates. Institutional punishment on
the other hand is highly complex and cannot arise from simpler strategies in either well-
mixed or community-structured populations.

On the other hand, Bayesian inference models used for linguistic phylogenies can in-
corporate highly correlated typological information, without a priori knowledge about
the underlying linguistic universals.

microbial ecology of LUCA. Among 286,514 protein clusters, we identified 355 protein families (∼0.1%) that trace to
LUCA by phylogenetic criteria. Because these proteins are not universally distributed, they can shed light on LUCA’s

reaction mechanisms. Its cofactors reveal dependence upon transition metals, flavins, S-adenosyl methionine, coenzyme A,
ferredoxin, molybdopterin, corrins and selenium. Its genetic code required nucleoside modifications and S-adenosyl

resemble that of LUCA, as basal among their respective domains. LUCA inhabited a geochemically active environment rich

Pedersen2016,"During the Last Glacial Maximum, continental ice sheets isolated Beringia (northeast Siberia and northwest North America) from unglaciated North America. By around 15 to 14 thousand calibrated radiocarbon years before present (cal. kyr bp), glacial retreat opened an approximately 1,500-km-long corridor between the ice sheets. It remains unclear when plants and animals colonized this corridor and it became biologically viable for human migration. We obtained radiocarbon dates, pollen, macrofossils and metagenomic DNA from lake sediment cores in a bottleneck portion of the corridor. We find evidence of steppe vegetation, bison and mammoth by approximately 12.6 cal. kyr bp, followed by open forest, with evidence of moose and elk at about 11.5 cal. kyr bp, and boreal forest approximately 10 cal. kyr bp. Our findings reveal that the first Americans, whether Clovis or earlier groups in unglaciated North America before 12.6 cal. kyr bp, are unlikely to have travelled by this route into the Americas.

Cai2016,"Most previous approaches to Chinese word segmentation formalize this prob- lem as a character-based sequence label- ing task so that only contextual informa- tion within fixed sized local windows and simple interactions between adjacent tags can be captured.

Our model employs a gated combination neural network over characters to produce distributed representations of word candi- dates, which are then given to a long short- term memory (LSTM) language scoring model.

Zhang2016,"Character-based and word-based methods are two main types of statistical models for Chinese word segmentation, the for- mer exploiting sequence labeling models over characters and the latter typically ex- ploiting a transition-based model, with the advantages that word-level features can be easily utilized. Neural models have been exploited for character-based Chi- nese word segmentation, giving high accu- racies by making use of external character embeddings, yet requiring less feature en- gineering. In this paper, we study a neu- ral model for word-based Chinese word segmentation, by replacing the manually- designed discrete features with neural fea- tures in a word-based segmentation frame- work. Experimental results demonstrate that word features lead to comparable per- formances to the best systems in the litera- ture, and a further combination of discrete and neural features gives top accuracies.","word segmentation, neural network, Chinese, NLP, transition, hierarchies"
Zhang2016,"What is interesting about this approach is that it uses some kind of hierarchy to carry out word segmentation, which is exactly what we would need for morphological segmentation: not a full-fledged segmentation into all elements, but instead a tree-representation that shows for each word a presumed hierarchy by which it was established.","word segmentation, hierarchies, Chinese, NLP, neural network"
Gutierrez2016,"Arbitrariness of the sign—the notion that the forms of words are unrelated to their meanings—is an underlying assumption of many linguistic theories. Two lines of research have recently challenged this as- sumption, but they produce differing char- acterizations of non-arbitrariness in lan- guage. Behavioral and corpus studies have confirmed the validity of localized form-meaning patterns manifested in lim- ited subsets of the lexicon. Meanwhile, global (lexicon-wide) statistical analyses instead find diffuse form-meaning system- aticity across the lexicon as a whole.

We bridge the gap with an approach that can detect both local and global form- meaning systematicity in language. In the kernel regression formulation we in- troduce, form-meaning relationships can be used to predict words’ distributional semantic vectors from their forms. Fur- thermore, we introduce a novel metric learning algorithm that can learn weighted edit distances that minimize kernel regres- sion error. Our results suggest that the English lexicon exhibits far more global form-meaning systematicity than previ- ously discovered, and that much of this systematicity is focused in localized form- meaning patterns.","semantic vectors, NLP, semantic change, arbitrariness, form-meaning pairs, automatic approach, English"

We apply our two models to corpora across three different languages. We find that semantic change is linear in two senses. Firstly, today’s embedding vectors (= meaning) of words can be derived as linear combinations of embedding vectors of their neighbors in previous time peri- ods. Secondly, self-similarity of words de- cays linearly in time.

Shoemark2016,"Recent work has proposed using network science to analyse the structure of the mental lexicon by viewing words as nodes in a phonological network, with edges connecting words that differ by a single phoneme. Comparing the structure of phonological networks across different languages could provide insights into linguistic typology and the cognitive pressures that shape lan- guage acquisition, evolution, and process- ing. However, previous studies have not considered how statistics gathered from these networks are affected by factors such as lexicon size and the distribution of word lengths. We show that these factors can substantially affect the statistics of a phonological network and propose a new method for making more robust comparisons. We then analyse eight languages, finding many commonalities but also some qualitative differences in their lexicon structure.","phonetic network, mental lexicon, edit distance, phoneme system, "

Dagan2006,"Two significant evolutionary processes are fundamentally not tree-like in nature - lateral gene transfer among prokaryotes and endosymbiotic gene transfer (from organelles) among eukaryotes. To incorporate such processes into the bigger picture of early evolution, biologists need to depart from the preconceived notion that all genomes are related by a single bifurcating tree.","family tree, phylogenetic network, core genome, tree of one percent, "
Dagan2006,"Evolutionary biologists like to think in terms of trees. Since Darwin, biologists have envisaged phylogeny as a tree-like process of lineage splittings. But Darwin was not concerned with the evolution of microbes, where lateral gene transfer (LGT; a distinctly non-treelike process) is an important mechanism of natural variation, as prokaryotic genome sequences attest [1-4]. Evolutionary biologists are not debating whether LGT exists. But they are debating - and heatedly so - how much LGT actually goes on in evolution. Recent estimates of the proportion of prokaryotic genes that have been affected by LGT differ 30-fold, ranging from 2% [5] to 60% [6]. Biologists are also hotly debating how LGT should influence our approach to understanding genome evolution on the one hand, and our approach to the natural classification of all living things on the other. These debates erupt most acutely over the concept of a tree of life. Here we consider how LGT and endosymbiosis bear on contemporary views of microbial evolution, most of which stem from the days before genome sequences were available.","lateral gene transfer, evolutionary biology, family tree,"
Dagan2006,"When it comes to the concept of a tree of life, there are currently two main camps. One camp, which we shall call the positivists, says that there is a tree of life, that microbial genomes are, in the main, related by a series of bifurcations, and that when we have sifted out a presumably small amount of annoying chaff (LGT), the wheat (the tree) will be there and will still our hunger for a grand and natural system [7-10].","lateral gene transfer, family tree, tree of life, "
Dagan2006,"The other camp, which we will call the microbialists,
says that LGT is just as natural among prokaryotes as is point mutation, and that furthermore, it has occurred throughout microbial history. This means that even were we to agree on a grand natural classification, the process of microbial evolution underlying it would be fundamentally undepictable as a single bifurcating tree, because a substantial component of the evolutionary process - LGT - is not tree-like to begin with [1,11,12].","family tree, lateral gene transfer, tree of life"
Dagan2006,"A recent paper by @Ciccarelli<2006> et al. [9] brings these two views head-to-head. It purports to weigh in heavily for the positivists, but in doing so it inadvertently provides some of the strongest support for the microbialist camp that has been published so far. A closer look reveals why. Ciccarelli et al. [9] report an automated procedure for identifying protein families that are universally distributed among all genomes, with pipeline alignment and tree building. Their routine looked for possible cases of LGT (detected as unusual tree topologies), excluded such proteins, and reiterated the procedure until the universe of proteins had been examined. This left them with 31 presumably orthologous protein sequences present in 191 genomes each, the alignments of which were concatenated to produce a data matrix with 8,089 sites (of which only 1,212 would have remained had gapped sites been excluded). A maximum likelihood tree was inferred from this matrix, motivating a brief discussion of some important events in life’s history as inferred from that tree.","family tree, tree of life, lateral gene transfer"
Dagan2006,"Bearing in mind that an average prokaryotic proteome  [pb]
represents about 3,000 protein-coding genes, the 31-protein tree of life represents only about 1% of an average prokary- otic proteome and only 0.1% of a large eukaryotic proteome. Thus, the positivists can say that there is a tree of life after all: a bit skimpier than expected, but a tree nonetheless. But the microbialists, glaring at the same data, can say that the glass is only 1% full at best, and more than 99% empty! There might be a tree there, but it is not the tree of life, it is the ‘tree of one percent of life’.","family tree, nice quote, tree of one percent, lateral gene transfer, tree of life"

According to Figure 2, this language Proto‐MNO must have developed more or less separately from Proto‐KL, the shared ancestor of modern languages K and L. This point is established through the identification of a number of linguistic innovations of various sorts (phonological, grammatical, lexical, etc.) which are jointly reflected by modern languages M, N and O, but not by other languages of the family.

The idea is that, instead of positing the same change in three languages (M, N, O) independently, it is more parsimonious – following Occam’s razor – to propose that it took place just once in a single language (Proto‐MNO) and then was simply inherited by its descendants.","family tree, shared innovation, Occam's razor, parsimony"

A strength, because it means that trees can help reconstruct events of social disruption when they indeed took place, and can represent them using a visually straightforward diagram. But it is also a weakness, because it distorts the reality of language diversification by shoehorning it into a one‐size‐fits‐all, simplistic model which forces us to reconstruct events of social separation even when they never really happened, at the expense of all other possible scenarios.

complete loss of contact, then it is difficult to imagine how some modern descendants of pMNO, but not others, could share anything with pKL. This principle of separate develop‐ ment is central to the whole logic of subgrouping studies under a cladistic approach, and has important consequences.","family tree, phylogenetic network, shared innovation, subgrouping"
Francois2014,"For example, the shared property may be proposed to be in fact a case of shared retention (also known as symplesiomorphy in phylogenetics) from the Proto‐ KLMNO ancestor, a property lost by other languages (K, NO): in this case, the property would not indicate any significant genealogical link between L and M – other than their remote relatedness. Alternatively, one could argue that the property is indeed innovative, yet happened independently in L and M, whether by drift or parallel innovation (homoplasy).

Finally, a third hypothesis would be that the property was innovated internally in only one language, say L, and then was borrowed by the other language M via contact between L and M, once they had already been formed as separate languages.

Francois2014,"Contact‐induced change, which can take place between any two languages regardless of their relatedness, is generally considered to be a separate phenomenon from the sort of “internal change” that underlies genealogical relations. The argument is that, for a property to be borrowed between two separate languages L and M, the two languages need to already exist independently; strictly speaking, the study of their genealogy is interested in how these languages came into existence, not in what happened to them later. Thus, the many words borrowed by English from Scandinavian languages during the Viking invasions, or later from French, are not considered to form part of its genealogical makeup: the English language had by that time already acquired independent existence, as it were, as a member of the Anglo‐Frisian branch of the West Germanic subgroup.

Francois2014,"They argue that loanwords, borrowed structures and other facts of cross‐linguistic diffusion form part of the linguistic history of languages as much as the material directly inherited. While the latter point is undoubtedly true, proponents of the Tree Model reply to this objection by acknowledging that trees are only intended to capture a portion of the history of languages, namely their genealogy strictly speaking, and nothing more. As for other facts of language development – notably the effects of contact – they are, or at least should be, treated by other models (Campbell & Poser 2008:327). This is a valid point, which bears keeping in mind every time family trees are cited: language genealogy only forms a portion of the historical picture, and trees should not be assigned more explanatory value than they actually have.

Francois2014,"This simplistic view was challenged as early as the end of the 19th century by the work of dialectologists (Gilliéron 1880, Wenker 1881), who showed that a given language typically consists of a network of dialects that can show a great deal of diversity. Language properties were found to be distributed in space following complex patterns, described visually using isoglosses.

Francois2014,"As for dialects and languages, they form more or less homogeneous systems shared by a network of mutually intelligible idiolects.

","mutual intelligibility, dialect network, language change, innovation, "
Francois2014,"Such a process is not fundamentally different from what is involved in language contact: both forms of diffusion involve the progression of a new linguistic behaviour across a social network of individual speakers – a process that is not reducible to a single event.

Francois2014,"Specifically, the language‐ internal diffusion of innovations does not have to target an entire language community, and commonly settles down to just a cluster of dialects, so that successive innovations target different segments of the network.

Francois2014,"Schuchardt, for example, linked it with a general disbelief in the Neogrammarians’ views on the regularity of sound change (Schuchardt 1885).

A synthesis should be possible, which preserves the principle of regularity and other useful tenets of the Comparative Method, yet replaces the simplistic tree representations with a wave‐inspired approach.","Hugo Schuchardt, wave theory, comparative method, irregularity of sound change, Neogrammarian sound change"
Francois2014,"As these dialects increase their differences and lose mutual intelligibility, the end result is an increase in the number of distinct languages. Yet crucially, whereas the Tree Model assigns linguistic diversification to social splits with loss of contact (§2.2), the Wave Model is compatible with scenarios where communities remain in contact. In fact, it treats linguistic contact – in the form of multiple, entangled events of diffusion across mutually intelligible dialects – as the very key to understanding patterns of language diversification (cf. François 2011a). This is a radical shift in perspective.

","wave theory, family tree, language split, diversification"
Francois2014,"One could propose that the two models are complementary, in the sense that trees would be well‐designed to represent the genealogical relations between separate LANGUAGES; whereas waves would only be concerned with the complex relations between DIALECTS within the boundaries of each language. The two models would then both be useful, but at different grains of observation. I think this view is wrong, for one important reason: namely, that many language (sub)families – as we will see below – have in fact arisen from the diversification of former dialect continua.

","family tree, wave theory, phylogenetic network, language history"
Francois2014,"This important point has been made by Malcolm Ross, around the concept of linkage (Ross 1988, 1996, 1997, 2001). Ross (1988:8) defines a linkage as “a group of communa‐ lects which have arisen by dialect differentiation”, where ‘communalect’ is a generic term which may refer to modern dialects or languages. When a dialect continuum – typically structured along the lines of Figure 3 above – evolves in such a way that its members lose mutual intelligibility, it becomes a linkage. A linkage thus consists of separate languages which are all related and linked together by intersecting layers of innovations; it is a language family that cannot be represented by any genealogical tree.

","linkages, dialect continuum, diversification, language history, family tree, wave theory"
Francois2014,"Would such social‐split signals justify preserving the Tree Model? Not necessarily, for two reasons. First, even if the existence of a separate AB cluster could be represented visually by a ‘branch’ linking Proto‐ABCDEFGH to Proto‐AB, the entangled isoglosses among CDEFGH would still be incompatible with a tree, and would need to be represented by waves anyway. All in all, a wave diagram such as Figure 3 is both necessary and sufficient to display the splits in question, and a tree would add nothing more.

","wave theory, isoglosses, language history"
Francois2014,"The second argument is of a more epistemological nature, and still favours the Wave Model even in situations of neat social split. Under the Tree Model, splits are assumed to be the only force underlying the formation of subgroups; this constitutes an aprioristic axiom for the whole model to hold together. By contrast, under a Wave approach, the identification of such splits is an empirical – and falsifiable – result of observation. In terms of historical reconstruction, this is an invaluable advantage of the latter method. In other words, Waves are not only better designed than Trees for tackling entangled situations of dialect continua and linkages; they even do better at detecting cases of neat split, which the cladistic model merely takes for granted.

","linguistic diffusion, isoglosses, shared innovation"
Francois2014,"Insofar as the Wave Model is agnostic as to whether genealogical subgroups should be expected to be nested or to intersect, it constitutes a more encompassing and flexible view of language diversification than the Tree Model; the latter approach entails a number of assumptions and simplifications which are not warranted by what we now know of the actual life of languages.

Francois2014,"At this point, I deliberately avoided making judgments – which would have been largely arbitrary – regarding whether a given innovation was a “common” or an “uncommon” type of change. While this precaution is made necessary by an all‐or‐nothing approach such as the Tree Model (where an uncommon change can serve as a fatal counterexample to a particular subgrouping hypothesis), it is much less relevant in a model capable of handling innovations in conflicting distributions. In fact, in the event that a subgroup AB were supported by ten ‘rare’ innovations and BC by ten ‘common’ ones, there would be no legitimate reason for considering AB to be more strongly supported than BC, and it would be legitimate to give equal weight to the two subgroups, regardless of the nature (common vs. uncommon) of their internal innovations.","shared innovation, shared retention, historical glottometry"
Francois2014,"My hypothesis, which proved successful, was that a large enough number of data points should yield a strong genealogical signal based on well supported subgroups, whereas any noise due to parallel innovations would be reduced, due to the low attestation of associated language clusters.","historical glottometry, shared innovation, shared retention"

Crangle2013,"This paper presents a new method of analysis by which structural similarities between brain data and linguistic data can be
assessed at the semantic level. It shows how to measure the strength of these structural similarities and so determine the
relatively better fit of the brain data with one semantic model over another. The first model is derived from WordNet, a
lexical database of English compiled by language experts. The second is given by the corpus-based statistical technique of
latent semantic analysis (LSA), which detects relations between words that are latent or hidden in text. The brain data are
drawn from experiments in which statements about the geography of Europe were presented auditorily to participants who
were asked to determine their truth or falsity while electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings were made. The theoretical
framework for the analysis of the brain and semantic data derives from axiomatizations of theories such as the theory of
differences in utility preference. Using brain-data samples from individual trials time-locked to the presentation of each
word, ordinal relations of similarity differences are computed for the brain data and for the linguistic data. In each case
those relations that are invariant with respect to the brain and linguistic data, and are correlated with sufficient statistical
strength, amount to structural similarities between the brain and linguistic data. Results show that many more statistically
significant structural similarities can be found between the brain data and the WordNet-derived data than the LSA-derived
data. The work reported here is placed within the context of other recent studies of semantics and the brain. The main
contribution of this paper is the new method it presents for the study of semantics and the brain and the focus it permits on
networks of relations detected in brain data and represented by a semantic model.","semantic similarity, cognition, "

Motomura2012,"The amino acid sequences of proteins determine their three-dimensional structures and functions. However, how sequence
information is related to structures and functions is still enigmatic. In this study, we show that at least a part of the sequence
information can be extracted by treating amino acid sequences of proteins as a collection of English words, based on a
working hypothesis that amino acid sequences of proteins are composed of short constituent amino acid sequences (SCSs)
or ‘‘words’’. We first confirmed that the English language highly likely follows Zipf’s law, a special case of power law. We
found that the rank-frequency plot of SCSs in proteins exhibits a similar distribution when low-rank tails are excluded. In
comparison with natural English and ‘‘compressed’’ English without spaces between words, amino acid sequences of
proteins show larger linear ranges and smaller exponents with heavier low-rank tails, demonstrating that the SCS
distribution in proteins is largely scale-free. A distribution pattern of SCSs in proteins is similar among species, but species-
specific features are also present. Based on the availability scores of SCSs, we found that sequence motifs are enriched in
high-availability sites (i.e., ‘‘key words’’) and vice versa. In fact, the highest availability peak within a given protein sequence
often directly corresponds to a sequence motif. The amino acid composition of high-availability sites within motifs is
different from that of entire motifs and all protein sequences, suggesting the possible functional importance of specific SCSs
and their compositional amino acids within motifs. We anticipate that our availability-based word decoding approach is
complementary to sequence alignment approaches in predicting functionally important sites of unknown proteins from
their amino acid sequences.","biological parallels, amino acid alphabet, protein structure, word embeddings"

Steel2013,"A major problem for inferring species trees from gene trees is that evolutionary processes can
sometimes favor gene tree topologies that conflict with an underlying species tree. In the case of
incomplete lineage sorting, this phenomenon has recently been well-studied, and some elegant
solutions for species tree reconstruction have been proposed. One particularly simple and statistically
consistent estimator of the species tree under incomplete lineage sorting is to combine three-taxon
analyses, which are phylogenetically robust to incomplete lineage sorting. In this paper, we consider
whether such an approach will also work under lateral gene transfer (LGT). By providing an exact
analysis of some cases of this model, we show that there is a zone of inconsistency when majority-rule
three-taxon gene trees are used to reconstruct species trees under LGT. However, a triplet-based
approach will consistently reconstruct a species tree under models of LGT, provided that the expected
number of LGT transfers is not too high. Our analysis involves a novel connection between the LGT
problem and random walks on cyclic graphs. We have implemented a procedure for reconstructing
trees subject to LGT or lineage sorting in settings where taxon coverage may be patchy and illustrate its
use on two sample data sets.","species tree, lateral gene transfer, consensus tree, algorithms, incomplete lineage sorting"

consistent with placing the human–chimpanzee and human–chimpanzee–gorilla speciation events at approximately 6

this is rarer around coding genes, indicating pervasive selection throughout great ape evolution, and has functional
consequences in gene expression. A comparison of protein coding genes reveals approximately 500 genes showing
accelerated evolution on each of the gorilla, human and chimpanzee lineages, and evidence for parallel acceleration,
particularly of genes involved in hearing. We also compare the western and eastern gorilla species, estimating an average
sequence divergence time 1.75 million years ago, but with evidence for more recent genetic exchange and a population
bottleneck in the eastern species. The use of the genome sequence in these and future analyses will promote a deeper

List2016g,"Background: For a long time biologists and linguists have been noticing surprising similarities between the
evolution of life forms and languages. Most of the proposed analogies have been rejected. Some, however, have
persisted, and some even turned out to be fruitful, inspiring the transfer of methods and models between biology and
linguistics up to today. Most proposed analogies were based on a comparison of the research objects rather than the
processes that shaped their evolution. Focusing on process-based analogies, however, has the advantage of minimizing
the risk of overstating similarities, while at the same time reflecting the common strategy to use processes to explain
the evolution of complexity in both fields.

Results: We compared important evolutionary processes in biology and linguistics and identified processes specific
to only one of the two disciplines as well as processes which seem to be analogous, potentially reflecting core
evolutionary processes. These new process-based analogies support novel methodological transfer, expanding the
application range of biological methods to the field of historical linguistics. We illustrate this by showing (i) how
methods dealing with incomplete lineage sorting offer an introgression-free framework to analyze highly mosaic
word distributions across languages; (ii) how sequence similarity networks can be used to identify composite and
borrowed words across different languages; (iii) how research on partial homology can inspire new methods and
models in both fields; and (iv) how constructive neutral evolution provides an original framework for analyzing
convergent evolution in languages resulting from common descent (Sapir’s drift).

Conclusions: Apart from new analogies between evolutionary processes, we also identified processes which are
specific to either biology or linguistics. This shows that general evolution cannot be studied from within one discipline
alone. In order to get a full picture of evolution, biologists and linguists need to complement their studies, trying to
identify cross-disciplinary and discipline-specific evolutionary processes. The fact that we found many process-based
analogies favoring transfer from biology to linguistics further shows that certain biological methods and models have
a broader scope than previously recognized. This opens fruitful paths for collaboration between the two disciplines.","incomplete lineage sorting, process-based analogies, biological parallels, similarity networks, constructive neutral evolution, word formation"

Flegontov2016,"In a recent interdisciplinary study, Das et al. have attempted to trace the homeland of Ashkenazi Jews and of their historical language, Yiddish (Das et al. 2016. Localizing Ashkenazic Jews to Primeval Villages in the Ancient Iranian Lands of Ashkenaz. Genome Biol Evol. 8:1132–1149). Das et al. applied the geographic population structure (GPS) method to autosomal genotyping data and inferred geographic coordinates of populations supposedly ancestral to Ashkenazi Jews, placing them in Eastern Turkey. They argued that this unexpected genetic result goes against the widely accepted notion of Ashkenazi origin in the Levant, and speculated that Yiddish was originally a Slavic language strongly influenced by Iranian and Turkic languages, and later remodeled completely under Germanic influence. In our view, there are major conceptual problems with both the genetic and linguistic parts of the work. We argue that GPS is a provenancing tool suited to inferring the geographic region where a modern and recently unadmixed genome is most likely to arise, but is hardly suitable for admixed populations and for tracing ancestry up to 1,000 years before present, as its authors have previously claimed.

Davidson2016,"Background: Species tree estimation is challenged by gene tree heterogeneity resulting from biological
processes such as duplication and loss, hybridization, incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), and horizontal gene
transfer (HGT). Mathematical theory about reconstructing species trees in the presence of HGT alone or ILS
alone suggests that quartet-based species tree methods (known to be statistically consistent under ILS, or under
bounded amounts of HGT) might be effective techniques for estimating species trees when both HGT and ILS
are present.

Results: We evaluated several publicly available coalescent-based methods and concatenation under maximum
likelihood on simulated datasets with moderate ILS and varying levels of HGT. Our study shows that two quartet-
based species tree estimation methods (ASTRAL-2 and weighted Quartets MaxCut) are both highly accurate, even
on datasets with high rates of HGT. In contrast, although NJst and concatenation using maximum likelihood are
highly accurate under low HGT, they are less robust to high HGT rates.

Conclusion: Our study shows that quartet-based species-tree estimation methods can be highly accurate under
the presence of both HGT and ILS. The study suggests the possibility that some quartet-based methods might
be statistically consistent under phylogenomic models of gene tree heterogeneity with both HGT and ILS.","incomplete lineage sorting, lateral gene transfer, species tree, phylogenetic reconstruction"

Straffon2016a,"The present volume is both timely and needed. The past couple of decades have

not familiar with evolutionary science, it may not be completely clear what phylo-
genetics is and why or how it should be applied in their fi eld of work. The aim of
this book is, on the one hand, to address precisely this issue and, on the other, to
offer a selection of clear examples of what phylogenetic methods can contribute to
archaeological research. This introduction will briefl y present the fi eld of phyloge-

human sciences in general and archaeology in particular.",-
Straffon2016a,"Basically, a phylogeny is a
hypothetical reconstruction of those evolutionary relationships, built by identifying
the distribution of characters among species and inferring their development. That
is, a phylogeny constitutes a hypothesis of an evolutionary history.

Phylogenetic systematics, also known as cladistics, refers to the methods of phy-
logenetics. The aim of these methods is to infer which organisms share ancestry
with others and the amount of evolutionary changes that may have occurred within
lineages. In this manner, cladistics organizes taxa in groups according to relatedness
(clades), by identifying shared characters among them, which have been inherited
from a common ancestor (shared derived characters, or synapomorphies).

Straffon2016a,"The result of a phylogenetic analysis is a cladogram, a branching diagram that
groups taxa by shared descent. Phylogenies may be represented as trees, lines, or
networks, which help visualize the processes of divergence, branching episodes,
and convergence, as well as continuity or extinction. Cladograms then serve to test
hypotheses about origin, relatedness, change, and, when coupled with a compara-
tive approach, adaptation.",-
Straffon2016a,"As we have noted, the mechanisms that allow for a phylogenetic classifi cation and
analyses are common descent and variation from the ancestral form. Therefore, phy-
logenetic methods are applicable to any trait or entity, whether genetic or cultural, as
long as it undergoes descent with modifi cation (@Levinson<2012> and Gray 2012 , 167).",-
Straffon2016a,"But biological and cultural evolution also differ in that the latter includes much
higher rates of horizontal transfer, hybridization, and borrowing than its genetic
counterpart, and its effects can occur much faster, in “Lamarckian” fashion (Gould
1996 , 355).",-
Straffon2016a,"It is fair to say that researchers involved in cultural evolution are nowadays quite
aware of these discussions and their challenges and, like the authors in this book,
have taken to fi nding ways of integrating evolutionary methods into their studies [pb]

must consider the particular properties of their subject.

Straffon2016a,"The methods of phylogenetics can be put to use in archaeological research in dif-
ferent ways. First, like in biology, they may be used to group related artifacts or series
of them (O’Brien et al. 2001 ). Second, they may be used to address what is known as
“Galton’s problem,” which refers to the issue of homology vs. analogy: cultural simi-
larities, like homologies in organisms, are unlikely to always be the result of indepen-
dent invention; rather, they may be attributed to a series of other factors, such as
common history, borrowing, diffusion, and coevolution. Constructing cultural phylog-
enies can help make inferences about those factors most likely to have shaped the
traits or artifact traditions under study (Mace and Pagel 1994 ; Mesoudi and O’Brien
2009 ). Third, like in linguistics, phylogenetic methods can add to the chronological
arrangement of cultural traditions (Gray and Atkinson 2003 ; Holden and Shennan

Kressing2016,"This contribution shows that evolutionary thought which dominated the
discourse on the development of human populations, cultures, and languages in the
nineteenth century (1) dates back to pre-Darwinian concepts that emerged in
the times of the Enlightenment, (2) was only possible due to an ongoing interdisciplin-
ary exchange between different branches of anthropology, and (3) was bound to the
idea that lateral exchange of “racial,” linguistic, or cultural traits would contribute to
degeneration instead of “progressive” development. Specifi cally, we would like to
draw the reader’s attention to two quite contradictory strains in the history of science:

Evolutionary thought dominated the discourse on the development of human
populations, cultures, and languages in the nineteenth century. According to this
“leitmotif,” inheritance took place in unilinear trees of descendence, with selection
and processes of vertical descent leading to development in consecutive stages.
Horizontal or lateral transfer, on the contrary, for example, of words between lan-
guages, or interbreeding between different species, populations, or “races” would
ultimately lead to degeneration instead of development, spoiling the supposedly
“pure” lineages of descent.

On the other hand, the development of evolutionary theory that had come to
dominate scholarly thought in biology, anthropology, linguistics, and sociology
could only emerge due to an ongoing interdisciplinary exchange between different
branches of the sciences and the humanities, with a decisive role played by anthro-
pology and allied disciplines. This means evolutionary theory favoring pure lines of
vertical descent could only develop due to frequent and ongoing “interbreeding”
between different scholarly disciplines, thus “spoiling” the pure lines of scientifi c
descent! This interdisciplinary, “horizontal” descent is illustrated by the fact that the
idea of biological evolution dates back to pre-Darwinian concepts that emerged in
the Enlightenment and was fi rst introduced to sociology and the humanities before
being applied to the newly emerging discipline of biology in the early nineteenth
century. While natural history can be traced back much further, the term “biology”
was only established at that time by physicians and naturalists like Beddoes ( 1799 ),
Burdach ( 1800 ), and Lamarck ( 1802 ).

This “horizontal transfer” of ideas transgressing the borders between the sci-
ences and humanities persisted even in periods of rejection of evolutionism in both
biology and cultural anthropology. We refer to “anthropology” in a broad sense,
combining sociocultural anthropology with biology-derived physical anthropology
and also including the neighboring disciplines of archaeology and linguistics in
accord with the four fi eld approach of North American anthropology. While the
borders of “anthropology” in this sense prove to be hard to defi ne, we understand
this as just another indication for the transgression of academic borders and inter-
disciplinary networking between scholars – a central topic to be put forward in our
paper.","history of science, anthropology, linguistics, family tree, biological parallels,"

and “degeneration” as central to this discourse. The two terms were by no means
exclusively used in anthropology, but also in neighboring disciplines, such as evo-

Exactly for this reason,
we have structured this paper around these two terms, in order to capture the
[pb]
many- faceted infl uences on theories of classifi cation and evolution of human popu-
lations and languages.",-
Kressing2016,"We will further show how the idea of evolution declined in biology, linguistics,
and cultural anthropology from the beginning of the twentieth century onward,
achieving fresh attention with the emergence of human genetics and linguistic long-
range comparison in the last quarter of the twentieth century. Again, we claim that
this new focus on the idea of coevolution of human languages and genetic clusters
is due to perpetuated “lateral transfer,” that means mutual exchange between differ-
ent academic disciplines in both the sciences and humanities [...].

primordialist ideas experienced a Renaissance in the shape of the “new synthesis”

Kressing2016,"Early models of morphological language typology, dating back to Smith ( 1762 ),
Herder ( 1772 ), Schlegel ( 1808 ), and Humboldt ( 1836 ), emphasize the linear devel-
opment from analytic, presumably “simple” built languages (e.g., Chinese) to
“higher,” more complex forms like the agglutinative idioms (e.g., Native American
languages) and fi nally to infl ective languages like Semitic or Indo-European.

",-
Kressing2016,"As a conclusion, we might point out that – in the nineteenth-century evolutionist’s
view – evolution works according to a pedigree model, involving vertical transfer.
Lateral or horizontal transfer, on the other hand, does not contribute to development
to higher stages on the evolutionary chain, but to an evolutionary backlash, i.e.,
degeneration, spoiling the lineage of the evolutionary tree. The discourse on degen-
eration by admixture of both “races” and languages presumes an acceptance of the
possibility of lateral transfer. This is illustrated by the fact that fear of degeneration
was a topic of concern in both racial theory and linguistics.

Kressing2016,"The origin of the term degeneration makes clear that the concept was primarily
developed and used in the medical fi eld, but by referring to Schleicher ( 1850 ), we

All these scholars form a scientifi c community (in the sense of Kuhn 1962 )
within anthropology, sharing an evolutionary approach to their work. The research
program of “global phylogeny” does not necessarily imply the idea of cultural, lin-

features (phonemes, morphemes), or memes, but emphasizes vertical transfer of
languages, culture, and genes as favored and prevailing feature of human evolution. [...]

Comparative linguists’ criticism is even more fundamental: They attack the data
sets, mainly based on the Swadesh Lists used for lexicostatistical and glottochrono-

Heggarty2010,"Linguists have traditionally represented patterns of divergence within a language family in terms of
either a ‘splits’ model, corresponding to a branching family tree structure, or the wave model, result-
ing in a (dialect) continuum. Recent phylogenetic analyses, however, have tended to assume the
former as a viable idealization also for the latter. But the contrast matters, for it typically reflects differ-
ent processes in the real world: speaker populations either separated by migrations, or expanding over
continuous territory. Since history often leaves a complex of both patterns within the same language
family, ideally we need a single model to capture both, and tease apart the respective contributions of
each. The ‘network’ type of phylogenetic method offers this, so we review recent applications to
language data. Most have used lexical data, encoded as binary or multi-state characters. We look
instead at continuous distance measures of divergence in phonetics. Our output networks combine
branch- and continuum-like signals in ways that correspond well to known histories (illustrated for
Germanic, and particularly English). We thus challenge the traditional insistence on shared inno-
vations, setting out a new, principled explanation for why complex language histories can emerge
correctly from distance measures, despite shared retentions and parallel innovations.","SplitsTree, Neighbor-Net, wave theory, family tree"
Heggarty2010,"This article claims that the split processes in linguistics differ, and that NeighborNets are better in representing dialect continua than family trees, which follows a bit upon the different processes asssumed in @Ross1988, where dialect divergence is distinguished from language divergence, although here, in this paper, SplitsTree and NeighborNets do not make a difference in the display, as was done by Ross.",-
Morrison2014b,"Exploratory data analysis (EDA) involving both graphical displays and numerical

ric ordinations such as principal components analysis. However, these techniques
have limiting mathematical assumptions that are not always realistic. Recently, net-
work techniques have been developed in the biological field of phylogenetics that
address some of these limitations. They are now widely used in biology under the
name phylogenetic networks, but they are actually of general applicability to any
multivariate dataset. Phylogenetic networks are fast and relatively easy to calcu-
late, which makes them ideal as a tool for EDA. This review provides an overview
of the field, with particular reference to the use of what are called splits graphs.
There are several types of splits graph, which summarize the multivariate data in
different ways. Example analyses are presented based on the neighbor-net graph,

been developed are many and, moreover, diverse. Whereas some of these may be

models.",-

world obey objective universal laws could not persuade someone who sustains that
each subject has its own perception and therefore rejects the search for general laws,
and vice versa.",-
Rivero2016,"Despite all this theoretical diversity, there is a common denominator to almost all
strands of archaeological thought: the untouchable philosophical cornerstone of
human intentionality as the only or, at the very best, the main mechanism driving
cultural change. Archaeological theories, therefore, widely accept that history is
constituted by progressive directional changes that are predetermined by people
themselves. As a result, all fields of knowledge concerned with the study of human
culture continue to be based mainly on an underlying Lamarckian model of change.",-
Rivero2016,"Biology has scientifically validated the Darwinian model of change, which is
empirically supported across diverse aspects of life. Not only is it fully supported
in the fields of organic biology, but also its likelihood has been recently demonstrated by the data available in areas of knowledge concerned with the study of
behavior and cultural change, particularly in certain fields of the social sciences
and in archaeology [...]. Moreover, this model fulfills the scientific values established by philosophers of science in relation to epistemology: simplicity, unifying power, fertility, internal coherence and external consistency,
Popperian falsifiability, and predictive precision [...].

Rivero2016,"The Darwinian model does not exclude the possible influence that
the variation and plasticity of human behaviors may produce upon change.
Rather, it sees these forces as functioning together with other mechanisms to
provoke change.",-
Rivero2016,"For Darwinists, the concept of evolution is based on the notion that the variability of populations changes over time and through space. Thus, the relative frequencies
of the different traits (both somatic and cultural) that constitute a population (or a
system comprised by several populations) do not remain constant, but rather vary in
time. The forces that drive change do not reside exclusively inside the organisms, as
may have been suggested by the pre-Darwinian concept of transformism. Apart
from the internal variation of organisms, produced by genetic mutation and behavioral innovation, for Darwinists, an important means of change is found outside of
the organisms.",-
Rivero2016,"Selection therefore constitutes the main mechanism due to which the relative

minds, for instance, the processes of pottery production that are codifi ed in the pot-

vessels, upon which selection operates. Thus, behaviors and material culture are [pb] phenotypes expressed through the minds of individuals and function in a similar
way to that of the genetic phenotype.","biological parallels"

traits in populations through time. Such an approach will help to understand the reasons behind the proliferation and decline of different archaeological materials. In
other words, it will provide explanations of cultural change.",analogy

and bacteria has been recognized (Margulis and Sagan 2002 ), and high rates of hori-

Lycett2016,"Recent years have seen substantial growth in the application of evolutionary approaches to spatial and temporal variation exhibited in archaeological
data. As is now well known, the application of this approach rests on the basis that
artifacts are an expression of a genuine evolutionary system mediated by transmission (via social learning), variation in transmitted elements, and differential replication of transmitted elements across time. While this provides the necessary
fundamental basis for the application of an evolutionary approach to artifactual
variation, application of the term “evolution” still provides a source of confusion for
some archaeologists. Part of this confusion may stem from an underdeveloped body
of theory that conceptually makes explicit the link between the evolution of socially
transmitted information and the expression of that evolutionary process in terms of
physical artifacts. This is especially the case given that artifactual variation is inevitably influenced by several different factors (e.g., raw material properties and/or
post manufacture attrition), not all of which are necessarily heritable in systems of
social learning. In order to resolve these difficulties and make more clear the case
for an evolutionary approach to artifactual variation, there is a need for an explicit
quantitative body of theory that links statistical variation in artifactual traits to factors such as selection and drift when (1) sources of artifact variation are multiple
and not all necessarily heritable, (2) the proximate socially transmitted elements are
unknown, and (3) many artifactual traits will be influenced simultaneously by mul-
tiple aspects of socially transmitted practices. Here, it is argued that a “quantitative
genetic” approach can resolve these problems.","artifact evolution, genotype, phenotype, archaeology, cultural evolution"
Lycett2016,"As others have noted (e.g., O’Brien and Lyman 2000; Shennan 2006), the roots of
applying evolutionary principles to archaeological data go back to the late 1800s
and early 1900s, during what some would now refer to as archaeology’s “cultural
historical” phase of intellectual development (Trigger 1989).",-
Lycett2016,"However, between the late 1970s and
early 1990s, a series of what have been rightly referred to as “benchmark” papers
were published (O’Brien 1996a: xiii), which explicitly began the brave task of try-
ing to convince an archaeological audience that principles originally developed to
study biological evolution might also be applicable to the archaeological record.",-
Lycett2016,"However,
it would be difficult for any archaeologist to be unaware of the considerable recent
expansion of archaeological studies now explicitly utilizing evolutionary principles
and methods. Importantly, one feature of this new generation of studies is their
highly empirical nature, something which some of its earliest proponents have
pointed out was sorely needed if the ield was to progress (O’Brien and Lyman
2000: 22).",-
Lycett2016,"It is
perhaps important to note that these evolutionary studies of material culture have
covered time periods from the Paleolithic through to ethnographically and histori-
cally recorded items and have dealt with artifact classes from across the globe as
diverse as pottery, stone tools, baskets, carpets, house architecture, and watercraft.
These above-listed studies, which have largely been published in scientific journals,
have been joined by a series of edited volumes that either in whole or in part also
deal with the application of evolutionary theory and methods to archaeological data
(e.g., Hurt and Rakita 2001; Mace et al. 2005; Lipo et al. 2006; O’Brien 2008;
Shennan 2009; Lycett and Chauhan 2010b; O’Brien and Shennan 2010; Ellen et al.

tions to which evolutionary studies of artifacts can, and indeed must be, applied.
Secondly, in so doing, they have illuminated the powerful potential of the archaeo-
logical record to shed direct light on issues of social inheritance, the existence of
variation, and the differential replication and persistence of those variants over the
dimensions of time and space.",-
Lycett2016,"However, despite such apparent attainment of legiti-
macy, it is still not unusual to encounter strong viewpoints arguing that such
approaches are, in effect, baseless. Indeed, personal experience at major interna-
tional conferences has led to recent situations where even highly accomplished col-
leagues within the profession are not necessarily coy about making statements such
as “phylogenetics cannot be applied to artifacts because artifacts don’t have genes”
or, similarly, “artifacts cannot evolve because they are inanimate objects.” Such
criticisms will be familiar to anyone seriously engaged in the evolutionary analysis
of artifactual variation, who have repeatedly pointed out the fallacious (and jaded)
character of such arguments, which can actually be traced back quite some time to
at least Brew’s (1946) assertion that “pots don’t breed” (e.g., see O’Brien and
Lyman 2000: 9).","nice quote, archaeology, scepticism, anecdote"
Lycett2016,"One particular reason why evolutionary approaches to artifactual variation may
cause confusion is the practical disconnect between the evolutionary process and
the expression of that evolutionary process in the form of artifacts.","genotype, phenotype, expression, idea, archaeology, terminology"
Lycett2016,"In strict terms, it is
genetic information systems that evolve in the case of biological evolution. Hence,
put bluntly, the skull of an individual horse can no more evolve than a pot used to
carry water, but that does not repudiate that both are expressions of evolving infor-
mation systems or, most importantly, that tracking their variation over time and
space cannot reveal important information about that underlying evolutionary pro-
cess",-
Lycett2016,"In the case of biology, that information system is coded at the molecular level
in “genes,” while the cultural information system is comprised of socially transmit-
ted ideas, concepts, beliefs, and/or practices that either consciously or otherwise
influence the form of the archaeological record at a particular time and geographic
locality.",-
Lycett2016,"For example,
information about some element of an activity involving tools may be drawn to the
attention of another because of usage, causing that latter individual to also adopt
that behavior (so-called *stimulus enhancement*). Alternatively, it might be informa-
tion about the manner in which a particular artifact looks and that form is later
copied (*emulation*), and/or it might involve repeating actual behavioral details (e.g.,
hand position during pottery production) which are then, in turn, copied (*imitation*).
It may also, of course, involve an individual directly and deliberately guiding the
attention and/or behavior of another such that the particular artifact is replicated
more readily (what many would term *teaching*) (e.g., Thornton and Raihani 2010).
Combinations of these mechanisms are also feasible.","stimulus enhancement, emulation, artifact evolution, imitation, teaching,"
Lycett2016,"In particular, three key points were increasingly rec-
ognized: 

(1) that traits of organisms are inluenced by both heritable and
nonheritable factors (e.g., “environmental” factors such as nutrition), 

(2) that individual quantitative traits of organisms (e.g., “height”) were simultaneously influenced by several different heritable elements, and 

(3) that while traits were
influenced by particulate inheritance according to Mendelian principles, patterns
of variation displayed by the majority of phenotypic characters were continuously
distributed in form (Provine 1971; Roff 1997).","environment, environmental factors, simultaneous influence, trait evolution"
Lycett2016,"However, given the
circuitous relationship between the evolution (i.e., descent with modification) of the
underlying information system and its physical expression in the form of artifacts, a
fully developed evolutionary approach requires a precise (i.e., quantitative) frame-
work that outlines—in specific terms—how patterns observed in physical forms
over time and space respond to evolutionary forces such as drift and selection when
individual objects are not themselves the entities that are evolving.",-
Lycett2016,"In biology, these matters were resolved by the
development of a field that eventually became known as “quantitative genetics”
(e.g., Falconer and Mackay 1996; Roff 1997).",-
Lycett2016,"Recently, a similar framework has been proposed and begun to be developed
as a means of tackling analogous problems inherent to the evolutionary analysis [pb]
of material artifacts (Lycett and von Cramon-Taubadel 2015).",-
Lycett2016,"Thereafter, these factors will be expanded upon, in quantitative terms, to show
more precisely how patterns of variation observed in the physical attributes of
artifacts over time and space can be linked directly to evolutionary forces such as
selection and stochastic factors when (1) sources of artifact variation are multi-
ple and not all necessarily heritable, (2) the proximate socially transmitted ele-
ments are unknown, and (3) many artifactual traits will be influenced
simultaneously by multiple aspects of socially transmitted practices.",-
Lycett2016,"This was compounded as experi-
ments began to demonstrate for the first time that variation between individuals was
caused not just by heritable components but also by “environmental” factors, such
as the soil conditions within which a plant grew (e.g., Johannsen 1909).","history of science, biology, phenotype"
Lycett2016,"What is now known as the field of “statistical quantitative genetics” provided the
urgently needed resolution to these problems (Roff 1997, 2007). A key element in
the development of quantitative genetics was Ronald Fisher’s (1918) insight that
unlike variations between different types of simple differences in classic “Mendelian”
traits (such as differences in flower color or between round versus wrinkled forms
of pea), which were caused by allelic differences at a single genetic locus, variation
in quantitative traits was caused by segregation of their heritable properties across [pb] 
multiple genetic loci. That is, most traits observed in organisms (especially quanti-
tative traits) are produced by the aggregate effects of two or more genes, leading
them to be described as “multifactorial” or “polygenic” features (Mayr 1982: 791–
792).

",-
Lycett2016,"When looking at quantitative variation in a phenotypic trait
across a collection (“population”) of individuals, this model expresses the total vari-
ance (V P ) observed as:

:math:`V_{Phenotype}=V_{Genetic} + V_{Environment}`

where V G is the proportion of phenotypic variance within the population controlled
by genetic factors and V E is the proportion of the variance caused by environmental
factors (see, e.g., Falconer 1960).",-
Lycett2016,"In sum, quantitative genetics explicitly takes account of the materiality of the
data it is using to study evolution, with the built-in recognition that it is looking at a
physical expression of an underlying information system that evolves via a process
of descent with modification.",-
Lycett2016,"There are many analogies between the problems that required the development
of quantitative genetic approaches to phenotypic traits and certain difficulties cur-
rently facing the evolutionary analysis of artifactual traits (Lycett and von Cramon-
Taubadel 2015). [...]
Hence, observable archaeological traits will invariably be influenced by
multiple unobservable and “pleiotropically” operating cultural elements, while also
simultaneously being influenced by “environmental” effects.",-
Lycett2016,"Just as in the biological case, a key point to note here is the reconciliatory effect this
framework can have on several different lines of research looking at patterns of
artifactual variability, which might otherwise seem in conflict. For instance, just
because a series of stone projectile points may have aspects of their variation influ-
enced by factors of raw material, or because of resharpening effects, does not negate
the fact that statistically meaningful patterns of variation resulting from important
evolutionary factors are also detectable in those artifacts and indeed allow evolu-
tionary questions to be addressed (Lycett and von Cramon-Taubadel 2015).",-
Lycett2016,"volution is undoubtedly a process of
“descent with modification” in which the three factors of variation, inheritance of
variation, and its differential replication are both the necessary and sufficient factors
for its operation. Nevertheless, however, much of this may be correct, in the strictest
of terms, a bird’s “wingspan” is not inherited by its offspring, nor does one pot
“inherit” the shape of its base from another pot; both of these physical features are
the material expression of information that is inherited within an evolving informa-
tion system.",-
Lycett2016,"In terms of a metric biological phenotypic trait (e.g., “length” of a skull, or beak “shape”), the heritability of the trait
(notated as H 2 ) is the proportion of the total phenotypic variance across the popula-
tion (i.e., V P ), expressed as a ratio of the variance attributable to genetic factors (i.e.,
V G ). Hence, simply:

:math:`H^2=\frac{V_G}{V_P}`

The use of the squared symbol here is a reminder that the parameter of heritability
is based on the descriptive statistic of variance (i.e., the standard deviation squared)
in terms of the two variables used to compute it.","heritability, formula, mathematical equation, phenotype,"
Lycett2016,"",-
Lycett2016,"Linking the raw statistical
data of artifactual variation to evolutionary processes is, however, by no means
straightforward, especially when some of that variation is caused by factors such as
raw material.",-
Lycett2016,"Quantitative genetics
helped resolve these difficulties by more explicitly quantifying the dynamics of
these factors and their interactions. It is one of the central arguments of this chapter
that a similar framework can help to resolve similar problems in the case of linking
variations in the physical traits of artifacts to evolutionary dynamics such as sto-
chastic factors (drift) and selection biases.",-
Lycett2016,"The practical benefit is that it provides a statistical basis for
studying artifactual variation and evolutionary patterning, framed expressly in
material terms. [...] [pb]

beyond the primary elements of “descent with modification” to express, in more
precise terms, the statistical mechanics of the relationship between selective biases,
stochastic factors, and the patterns they create in measureable data. As an outgrowth,
the theoretical benefit is that it will help to refocus the way we frame and explain
what is being studied and how it is being used to examine the evolution of the under-
lying information system—something which is entirely unobservable.",-
Lycett2016,"Article explains mostly how ideas from phenotype studies in biology can be used to asses things like heretability, influcence of drift, selection or environmental factors in artifact evolution. This is illustrated in a small example. The interesting point is that the author mainly sticks to phenetics in the evolutionary considerations (as basically does the whole book). This is interesting, as it shows that archaeologists do not even think to come close to anything like the stochastic frameworks developed for genetics, but rather stick to those things who are more interesting for them, namely the distinction of the factors that shape the objects they investigate, be it selection, drift, or enviroment (material in the case of artifacts).",-
Tripp2016,"Numerous studies have interpreted the anthropomorphic “Venus” statuettes of the Gravettian. However, few of these studies have scrutinized the figurines
at an individual level or used quantitative analyses in order to understand similarities within sites or between regions. This study tests two hypotheses. The first one,
by Leroi-Gourhan, suggests that the Gravettian statuettes share core similarities
regardless of where they were created. If correct, statuettes should not be grouped
according to the region that they were made. The second hypothesis, by Gvozdover,
suggests a Kostenki-Avdeevo unity. Her hypothesis suggests blending among cul-
tures in the Russian Plains and that there are “types” of statuettes that are not
restricted to a particular site. Here cladistics methods are used in order to under-
stand whether ethnogenesis (blending) or cladogenesis (branching) has occurred in
the production of “Venus” making. Results confi rm and extend Gvozdover’s hypoth-
esis suggesting cultural and ideological connections for “Venus” making in the
Russian Plains and also support the uniqueness of a few European statuettes.","cladistics, archaeology, cultural evolution, quantitative analysis"
Tripp2016,"Article tests basically two different hypotheses on the origin of the Venus figurines, which some scholars think go back to a similar tradition, while other think they were developed independently. The article uses cladistics to see whether the two hypotheses show expected branching patterns on a set of binary characters for which the data was coded. This analysis is somewhat disappointing, since it is not clear why at all phylogenetic analyses should be used, given that it is not even clear that the data reflects related traditions. Hypothesis 2 wins, which claims that there was a coherent tradition in the Russian region while not in others, but this could have equally easy been obtained by using any kind of cluster analysis, namely fuzzy clusters, link communities or other things.","archaeology, cladistics, Venus figurines, cultural evolution"
Tripp2016,"More than 50 such figurines, frequently termed “Venuses,” were [pb]
discovered at sites from France to Siberia and as far south as Italy and are dated to
the Gravettian.",-
Tripp2016,"Since the majority of the statuettes is female and is nude, this has led many
researchers to suggest that the fi gurines were created for a uniform same purpose
(Soffer and Praslov 1993 ).",-
Tripp2016,"At present, there has not been a single study demonstrating that the aforementioned artifacts are a homogenous group based on any particular combination of
shared stylistic features. The figurines are only assumed to represent a cohesive unit
because many of the statuettes are nude and female and have exaggerated sexual
features. This however masks the diversity that is apparent when examining individual figurines. Not all figurines are female, many appear to be wearing clothing, and a
diversity of body shapes is also apparent (apple, pear, reversed triangle). In fact, from
the discovery and initial interpretation of Gravettian female statuettes, they were [pb]
never considered homogeneous.",-
Tripp2016,"He believed that
the fi gurines represented a realistic interpretation of two different Paleolithic races
(White 2006 ), one of which, he believed, was inferior and characterized by having
greater fat deposits, especially in the stomach, hip, and thigh regions. He labeled
these as “Venuses” and directly connected these fi gurines with modern day Bushman,
specifi cally with Saartjie Baartman. [...]
This terminology has caused much unwarranted confusion because it assumes
affi liation. In fact, many archaeologists simply presuppose that we are dealing with
a cohesive group of objects, since they are all called “Venuses” (Nelson 1990 ). The
application of the term also reinforced the idea that the Gravettian female fi gurines
share a single function (Nelson 1990 ). The notion of shared usage did not come
from microscopic analysis or contextual analysis but from the term “Venus.”",-
Tripp2016,"In the present paper, I will argue that in order to understand regional connections,
we fi rst need to look at individual differences. To investigate this, I will use cladis-
tics to test two contrasting hypotheses, one by Leroi-Gourhan (1982) and the other
by Gvozdover ( 1989 ).",-
Tripp2016,"Both of these hypotheses can be tested through the use of a cladistics analysis
and each would lead to the creation of different diagrams. Leroi-Gourhan’s
hypothesis, henceforth referred to as hypothesis 1, suggests that regardless of their [pb]
location, they share major features. This would suggest that statuettes from each
region would be spread across the tree indiscriminately, i.e., there would be no clear
geographic clustering in the dataset. This would support Leroi-Gourhan’s hypothe-
sis as he does not suggest that statuettes from one region, or site, share more simi-
larities with each other than those from another group. Hypothesis 2, by Gvozdover
( 1989 ), argues for similarities in artistic industries among the sites in the Russian
Plains including Kostenki I, Avdeevo, New Avdeevo, Gagarino, and Khotylevo
II. More specifi cally, she argued for the presence of Kostenki, Avdeevo, and
Gagarino-type statuettes but suggested that they were not limited to a single site.
This hypothesis suggests contact and blending of Russian artistic cultures.",-
Tripp2016,"By exploring regional patterning, this analysis will also provide insight into cul-
tural evolution. Specifi cally, it will clarify whether vertical (branching) or horizon-
tal (blending) transmission had a greater effect on “Venus” making in the Gravettian",-
Tripp2016,"The sample size for this analysis was composed of 30 discrete traits of equal weight
found on 27 statuettes. Only statuettes that were complete and anthropomorphic
(i.e., clearly human-like) in nature were included in the study.",-
Tripp2016,"The retention index
associated with the most parsimonious cladogram was 0.443. As the cladogram
shows, several fi gurines do not share direct associations with other statuettes
including the Venus of Pavlov, the Lozenge, Moravany, the Bicephalous, and
Lespugue. For the most part, the Russian Plains statuettes group together, while
the Central, Southern, and Western European statuettes groups spread throughout
the tree.",-
Tripp2016,"The results do not support hypothesis 1. As is evident in the character trait list,
there are multiple head shapes and sizes, arm and leg positions and proportions,
breast and buttock shapes, as well as decoration types and locations. Additionally,
this hypothesis predicts a high amount of homoplasy and that statuettes should
group indiscriminately on the tree. If this hypothesis were correct, the RI should be
much closer to zero. An RI of .443 indicates that some branching is occurring.
Also, the fact that the Venus of Pavlov, the Lozenge, Moravany, the Bicephalous,
and Lespugue form terminal branches demonstrates how unique each of these fi gu-
rines is.",-
Tripp2016,"Lastly, it is important to note that both hypotheses predicted blending among
Gravettian cultures and did not predict strict cultural phylogenesis at the site level.
The cladogram corroborates this point, as archaeological sites do not form mono-
phyletic groups. Instead, the results of the cladogram demonstrate a blending of the
Eastern European sites.",-
Tripp2016,"Too many hypotheses surrounding the “Venus” fi gurines have begun with the
assumption that the fi gurines share core similarities but offer little explanation as to
what those features are. This analysis has shown that in fact there are regional con-
nections in art making among sites within the Russian Plains but also documents the
uniqueness and diversity of individual statuettes from other regions. Importantly,
these data also demonstrate that the fi gurines are not “practically interchangeable”
as argued by Leroi-Gourhan. In order to make larger connections about what these
fi gurines were used for, we need to start by analyzing individual statuettes.",-
Knappett2016,"Although the use of neo-Darwinian models to explain culture change has
become quite common in some subfi elds of archaeology, there remains much resistance within ‘interpretive’ archaeologies to what is perceived as the simplistic ‘biologisation’ of culture. Some recent work has sought to build bridges between
evolutionary and interpretive archaeologies, with the topic of ‘learning’ emerging as
a useful middle ground between these two standpoints. Yet significant barriers
remain to a more thorough integration. Here I identify what appear to be two such
barriers: one is the continued commitment in neo-Darwinian approaches to a
Cartesian notion of ‘information’ and the second is the related adherence to the idea
of distinct cultural ‘traits’. I draw on work in cognitive science and developmental
biology that places heavy emphasis on the distributed and contextual nature of learning, such that the uptake of an innovative technology cannot be reduced to a process
of information transfer for learning a new trait. A distributed and developmental
approach is put into play through a case study tackling the variable regional and
temporal adoption of the potter’s wheel across the Bronze Age east Mediterranean.","learning, cultural evolution, potter's wheel, archaeology"
Knappett2016,"Article gives a critical account, and sells this as a critical account on evolutionary thinking in archaeology. In the end, however, the article does not criticize evolutionary thinking, but reductionism, by demonstrating that many supposedly simple variables, like ""learning"" of things, cannot be reduced to a simple process, but should rather be carefully analysed in multiple ways. That substantiates the importance of consilience and cumulative evidence which is generally important in the historical sciences.","cumulative evidence, archaeology, cultural evolution, learning"
Knappett2016,"In this paper I use an archaeological example to address processes of technological
innovation, challenging the validity of most neo-Darwinian biological models for
explaining certain important kinds of cultural change. Archaeology can provide
useful case studies because of its capacity to identify the spread of artefacts and
techniques over broad regions and long time spans.",-
Knappett2016,"This innovation then provides a challenge to some typical neo-Darwinian
approaches to cultural evolutionary change. In such approaches, it seems diffi cult to
get away from the idea that culture consists of units of ‘information’ of some kind.
As Jordan ( 2014 , 2) quite explicitly puts it:

.. pull-quote::
  human technological traditions...consist of information stored in human brains that is then
  passed on to other individuals through social learning.

Jordan goes on to assert that technological traditions are ‘material manifestations
of a complex transmission system’ ( 2014 , 2). So we have here a conception of cul-
ture as bundles of information in the brain—a set of mental states or ideas. This
means that the material world is, in effect, epiphenomenal.",-
Knappett2016,"A second, related limitation concerns the defi nition of the cultural ‘trait’ as a
basic unit of technological traditions. Jordan ( 2014 , 5–6) argues that specifi c design
traits can be combined in various ways, and it is the choices of how to combine them
that make up material culture traditions. His use of the term ‘design grammars’
betrays the conception of these combinations as functioning in a modular manner,
like language. However, material cultural traits are not created as interchangeable
units readily understood according to formal convention. Generally speaking, there
does not seem to exist a language of material culture traits such that, within pottery
making, for example, one can just swap out coil building for wheel throwing as if
they are interchangeable modules.","design grammars, cultural evolution, "
Knappett2016,"As Roux puts it, evolutionary models
rely on ‘the hypothesis that contacts between people are necessary and sufficient
for social learning to occur’ (Roux 2013 , 313).  Roux challenges this basic assertion of social Darwinian approaches, noting that there are many documented
instances in which people may ‘learn’ about a new trait or technique, but nevertheless choose not to adopt it. The decision to adopt, she stresses, depends not
just on the existence of contact but on the nature of that contact.",-
Knappett2016,"I have found the developmental
approach propounded by Wimsatt and Griesemer very useful in this regard, as
they explicitly argue for the concept of scaffolding as an important (and largely
missing) cog in any successful attempt at evolutionary explanation (Wimsatt and
Griesemer 2007 ; Caporael et al. 2014 ).",-
Knappett2016,"What is especially interesting though is
that the wheel technique sees a targeted rather than a widespread adoption [...].",-
Knappett2016,"We have described above three regions where, for whatever reasons, the wheel
technique does see full or almost full adoption. However, there are many other
regions where the wheel is taken up as a technology in much more piecemeal fash-
ion.",-
Knappett2016,"If we were to begin with the assumption that the wheel technique offers obvious
advantages over hand-building techniques in terms of both the quality and quan-
tity of output, then we might expect to see a regular, smooth uptake of the inno-
vation as soon as it becomes available to ancient potters. That is, if they are in
contact with potters who have the wheel, then they will surely copy that tech-
nique. Yet, when we look at the evidence from across the east Mediterranean in
the Early and Middle Bronze Age, what we see is anything but a predictable
adoption of the technology of the potter’s wheel.",-
Knappett2016,"The technique, it would seem, takes on a different status
depending on precisely how it is learnt—and we must stress that it is a technique
that is diffi cult to acquire, usually requiring some kind of apprenticeship (see
Roux and Corbetta 1990 ; also Wendrich 2012 on apprenticeship more broadly).
And given this diffi culty, it seems likely that there would exist different strate-
gies for learning, which we might understand in terms of various mixes of
declarative and nondeclarative knowledge.",-
Knappett2016,"If we are then arguing that a variety of strategies may exist for learning a ‘single’
technique such as the potter’s wheel, and that these strategies may rely differentially
on knowledge embedded in the environment (i.e. scaffolding), then what are the
implications for evolutionary approaches to cultural transmission? It should at the
very least make us question the notion of the potter’s wheel as a ‘cultural trait’,

One dataset for skateboard decks and one for projectile points. What is suprising in the article is that the authors use family tree models to test for the mosaic evolution, but also for the evolution in general of the objects, since these are clearly not the typical objects where one would expect that evolution was tree-like. For the following two reasons:

1. The objects are artifacts and built by humans for specific reasons. So the question is what would constitute the vertical signal here anyway? Is it that X is apprentice from Y when creating the next generation of the object? Was X influenced by Y? But how can that be tree-like, unless it was, say, a teacher-apprentice relation (which was never the case for skateboard evolution, as I assume, as people would just copy those ideas from each other).
2. The objects may be ancestral to each other. Clearly, in some sense, the first skateboard every produced is the ancestor of all the other skateboards, unless it was invented two times independently.

In fact, among prehistoric hunter-gatherers, few others existed beside face-to-face

of rock art and its information storing capacity. This idea has been formalized in
the “information storage model” (Barton et al. 1994; Conkey 1978; Gamble 1991;

Caridi2016,"Rock art is a product of Cultural Transmission. In a systemic context (sensu
Schiffer 1972), we assume that the process leading to the distribution of motifs in
the landscape begins when someone paints a motif on one site. That very same per-
son, or another, could store it in his/her memory and reproduce it at the same site or
elsewhere (immediately or at a later moment). There, the motif is seen by others
who repeat it and can add other motifs. This process iterates for days, years, and/or
centuries. As a result, some motifs will not be reproduced, while others will be dis-
tributed in a wide area. In this manner, we obtain a process of Cultural Transmission
in which a social network replicates a set of motifs. The product of that process is a
differential pattern of motif distribution in the landscape. In archaeology, we cannot
track that social network because it is gone, but we have a “fossil” pattern, a relic of
that process. Since the pattern does not mirror the network that produced it (reasons
below), we need to introduce a new concept in order to separate the process (related
to social network activities) and its (patterned) material evidence. On this basis, we
can model a Cultural Transmission Path (CTP), a pattern left as a rock art motif
distribution in the landscape (space) corresponding to a social network (social rela-

social repertoire, and shared graphics would be present across thousands of

Background

Curious parallels between the processes of species and language evolution have been observed by many researchers. Retracing the evolution of Indo-European (IE) languages remains one of the most intriguing intellectual challenges in historical linguistics. Most of the IE language studies use the traditional phylogenetic tree model to represent the evolution of natural languages, thus not taking into account reticulate evolutionary events, such as language hybridization and word borrowing which can be associated with species hybridization and horizontal gene transfer, respectively. More recently, implicit evolutionary networks, such as split graphs and minimal lateral networks, have been used to account for reticulate evolution in linguistics.
Results

Striking parallels existing between the evolution of species and natural languages allowed us to apply three computational biology methods for reconstruction of phylogenetic networks to model the evolution of IE languages. We show how the transfer of methods between the two disciplines can be achieved, making necessary methodological adaptations. Considering basic vocabulary data from the well-known Dyen’s lexical database, which contains word forms in 84 IE languages for the meanings of a 200-meaning Swadesh list, we adapt a recently developed computational biology algorithm for building explicit hybridization networks to study the evolution of IE languages and compare our findings to the results provided by the split graph and galled network methods.
Conclusion

We conclude that explicit phylogenetic networks can be successfully used to identify donors and recipients of lexical material as well as the degree of influence of each donor language on the corresponding recipient languages. We show that our algorithm is well suited to detect reticulate relationships among languages, and present some historical and linguistic justification for the results obtained. Our findings could be further refined if relevant syntactic, phonological and morphological data could be analyzed along with the available lexical data.

Blasi2016,"It is widely assumed that one of the fundamental properties of spoken language is the arbitrary relation between sound and meaning. Some exceptions in the form of nonarbitrary associations have been documented in linguistics, cognitive science, and anthropology, but these studies only involved small subsets of the 6,000+ languages spoken in the world today. By analyzing word lists covering nearly two-thirds of the world’s languages, we demonstrate that a considerable proportion of 100 basic vocabulary items carry strong associations with specific kinds of human speech sounds, occurring persistently across continents and linguistic lineages (linguistic families or isolates). Prominently among these relations, we find property words (“small” and i, “full” and p or b) and body part terms (“tongue” and l, “nose” and n). The areal and historical distribution of these associations suggests that they often emerge independently rather than being inherited or borrowed. Our results therefore have important implications for the language sciences, given that nonarbitrary associations have been proposed to play a critical role in the emergence of cross-modal mappings, the acquisition of language, and the evolution of our species’ unique communication system.

Experimentally, participants mapped longer words to more complex objects in comprehension and production tasks and across a range of stimuli. Explicit judgments of conceptual complexity were also highly correlated with implicit measures of study time in a memory task, suggesting that complexity is directly related to basic cognitive processes. Observationally, judgments of conceptual complexity for a sample of real words correlate highly with their length across 80 languages, even controlling for frequency, familiarity, imageability, and concreteness. While word lengths are systematically related to usage—both frequency and contextual predictability—our results reveal a systematic relationship with meaning as well.

Background

The multispecies coalescent model has become popular in recent years as a framework to infer a species phylogeny from multilocus genetic data collected from multiple individuals. The model assumes that speciation occurs at a specific point in time, after which the two sub-species evolve in total isolation. However in reality speciation may occur over an extended period of time, during which sister lineages remain in partial contact. Inference of multispecies phylogenies under those conditions is difficult. Indeed even designing simulators which correctly sample gene histories under these conditions is non-trivial.
Results

In this paper we present a method and software which simulates gene trees under both the multispecies coalescent and migration. Our approach allows for both population sizes and migration rates to change over the species lifetime. Also, migration rates are specified in units of fraction of emigrants per time unit, which makes them easier to interpret. Overall this setup covers a wide range of migration scenarios. The software can be used to investigate properties of gene trees under different migration settings and to generate test cases for programs which infer species trees and/or migration from sequence data. Using simulated data we investigate the effect of migrations between sister lineages on the inference of multispecies phylogenies and on post analysis detection.
Conclusions

Our results indicate that while estimation of species tree topology can be quite robust to the presence of gene flow, the inference and detection of migration is problematic, even with methods based on full likelihood models.

Edwards2016,"In recent articles published in Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution, Mark Springer and John Gatesy (S&G) present numerous criticisms of recent implementations and testing of the multispecies coalescent (MSC) model in phylogenomics, popularly known as “species tree” methods. After pointing out errors in alignments and gene tree rooting in recent phylogenomic data sets, particularly in Song et al. (2012) on mammals and Xi et al. (2014) on plants, they suggest that these errors seriously compromise the conclusions of these studies. Additionally, S&G enumerate numerous perceived violated assumptions and deficiencies in the application of the MSC model in phylogenomics, such as its assumption of neutrality and in particular the use of transcriptomes, which are deemed inappropriate for the MSC because the constituent exons often subtend large regions of chromosomes within which recombination is substantial. We acknowledge these previously reported errors in recent phylogenomic data sets, but disapprove of S&G’s excessively combative and taunting tone. We show that these errors, as well as two nucleotide sorting methods used in the analysis of Amborella, have little impact on the conclusions of those papers. Moreover, several concepts introduced by S&G and an appeal to “first principles” of phylogenetics in an attempt to discredit MSC models are invalid and reveal numerous misunderstandings of the MSC. Contrary to the claims of S&G we show that recent computer simulations used to test the robustness of MSC models are not circular and do not unfairly favor MSC models over concatenation. In fact, although both concatenation and MSC models clearly perform well in regions of tree space with long branches and little incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), simulations reveal the erratic behavior of concatenation when subjected to data subsampling and its tendency to produce spuriously confident yet conflicting results in regions of parameter space where MSC models still perform well. S&G’s claims that MSC models explain little or none (0–15%) of the observed gene tree heterogeneity observed in a mammal data set and that MSC models assume ILS as the only source of gene tree variation are flawed. Overall many of their criticisms of MSC models are invalidated when concatenation is appropriately viewed as a special case of the MSC, which in turn is a special case of emerging network models in phylogenomics. We reiterate that there is enormous promise and value in recent implementations and tests of the MSC and look forward to its increased use and refinement in phylogenomics.","multispecies coalescent model, coalescent theory, gene tree reconciliation, species tree"

  predecessors, and the argument took the shape of 'Do you ask what it's made

  stood for inquiry into pattern rather than inquiry into substance. That controversy
  has gone through the ages, and the Pythagorean half of it has, until recently,
  been on the whole the submerged half. (Bateson 1972: 449)

are. We tested the mutual intelligibility of 15 Chinese dialects functionally at the level of isolated words (word-intelligibility) and
the level of sentences (sentence intelligibility). We collected data for each dialect by playing isolated words and sentences spoken in
15 Chinese dialects to 15 listeners. Word-intelligibility was determined by having listeners perform a semantic categorization task
whereby words had to be classified as one of ten different categories such as body part, plant, animal, etc. Sentence intelligibility
was estimated by having the listeners translate a target word in each sentence into their own dialect. We obtained 47,250 data
(15  150  15 for the word part and 15  60  15 for the sentence part). We also had at our disposal structural similarity measures
(lexical similarity, phonological correspondence) for each pair of the 15 Chinese dialects published by Cheng (Computational
Linguistics & Chinese Language Processing 1997, 2.1, pp. 41–72). Our general conclusion is that the degree of mutual intelligibility
can be determined by both opinion and functional tests. These two subjective measures are significantly correlated with one another
and can be predicted from objective measures (lexical similarity and phonological correspondence) equally well. However,
functional intelligibility measures, especially at the sentence level, better reflect Chinese dialect classifications than opinion scores.

List2016h,"Background: For a long time biologists and linguists have been noticing surprising similarities between the
evolution of life forms and languages. Most of the proposed analogies have been rejected. Some, however, have
persisted, and some even turned out to be fruitful, inspiring the transfer of methods and models between biology and
linguistics up to today. Most proposed analogies were based on a comparison of the research objects rather than the
processes that shaped their evolution. Focusing on process-based analogies, however, has the advantage of minimizing
the risk of overstating similarities, while at the same time reflecting the common strategy to use processes to explain
the evolution of complexity in both fields.

Results: We compared important evolutionary processes in biology and linguistics and identified processes specific
to only one of the two disciplines as well as processes which seem to be analogous, potentially reflecting core
evolutionary processes. These new process-based analogies support novel methodological transfer, expanding the
application range of biological methods to the field of historical linguistics. We illustrate this by showing (i) how
methods dealing with incomplete lineage sorting offer an introgression-free framework to analyze highly mosaic
word distributions across languages; (ii) how sequence similarity networks can be used to identify composite and
borrowed words across different languages; (iii) how research on partial homology can inspire new methods and
models in both fields; and (iv) how constructive neutral evolution provides an original framework for analyzing
convergent evolution in languages resulting from common descent (Sapir’s drift).

Conclusions: Apart from new analogies between evolutionary processes, we also identified processes which are
specific to either biology or linguistics. This shows that general evolution cannot be studied from within one discipline
alone. In order to get a full picture of evolution, biologists and linguists need to complement their studies, trying to
identify cross-disciplinary and discipline-specific evolutionary processes. The fact that we found many process-based
analogies favoring transfer from biology to linguistics further shows that certain biological methods and models have
a broader scope than previously recognized. This opens fruitful paths for collaboration between the two disciplines.","analogy, biological parallels, history of science, "

Hippisley1998,"Recent lexeme-based models have proposed that a lexeme carries an inventory
of stems on which morphological rules operate. The various stems in the
inventory are associated with different morphological rules, of both inflection
and derivation. Furthermore, one stem may be selected by more than one rule.
For this reason stems in the inventory are labeled with indexes, rather than
being directly associated with a particular morphological function. It is claimed
that an indexed-stem approach captures generalizations in the morphological
system that would otherwise be missed. We argue that such an approach
provides for greater generalization in the Russian morphological system. One
area of Russian derivation that particularly lends itself to an indexed-stem
approach is the highly productive system of personal-noun formation. We

posit either compound suffixes or ""concatenators"" and on the other dispenses

Fedorenko2016,"The neural processes that underlie your ability to read and understand this sentence are unknown. Sentence comprehension occurs very rapidly, and can only be understood at a mechanistic level by discovering the precise sequence of underlying computational and neural events. However, we have no continuous and online neural measure of sentence processing with high spatial and temporal resolution. Here we report just such a measure: intracranial recordings from the surface of the human brain show that neural activity, indexed by γ-power, increases monotonically over the course of a sentence as people read it. This steady increase in activity is absent when people read and remember nonword-lists, despite the higher cognitive demand entailed, ruling out accounts in terms of generic attention, working memory, and cognitive load. Response increases are lower for sentence structure without meaning (“Jabberwocky” sentences) and word meaning without sentence structure (word-lists), showing that this effect is not explained by responses to syntax or word meaning alone. Instead, the full effect is found only for sentences, implicating compositional processes of sentence understanding, a striking and unique feature of human language not shared with animal communication systems. This work opens up new avenues for investigating the sequence of neural events that underlie the construction of linguistic meaning.

Crivelli2016,"Theory and research show that humans attribute both emotions and intentions to others on the basis of facial behavior: A gasping face can be seen as showing “fear” and intent to submit. The assumption that such interpretations are pancultural derives largely from Western societies. Here, we report two studies conducted in an indigenous, small-scale Melanesian society with considerable cultural and visual isolation from the West: the Trobrianders of Papua New Guinea. Our multidisciplinary research team spoke the vernacular and had extensive prior fieldwork experience. In study 1, Trobriand adolescents were asked to attribute emotions, social motives, or both to a set of facial displays. Trobrianders showed a mixed and variable attribution pattern, although with much lower agreement than studies of Western samples. Remarkably, the gasping face (traditionally considered a display of fear and submission in the West) was consistently matched to two unpredicted categories: anger and threat. In study 2, adolescents were asked to select the face that was threatening; Trobrianders chose the “fear” gasping face whereas Spaniards chose an “angry” scowling face. Our findings, consistent with functional approaches to animal communication and observations made on threat displays in small-scale societies, challenge the Western assumption that “fear” gasping faces uniformly express fear or signal submission across cultures.

humans, has a significant phylogenetic component. By compiling
sources of mortality from a comprehensive sample of mammals,
we assessed the percentage of deaths due to conspecifics and,
using phylogenetic comparative tools, predicted this value for
humans. The proportion of human deaths phylogenetically
predicted to be caused by interpersonal violence stood at 2%.
This value was similar to the one phylogenetically inferred for
the evolutionary ancestor of primates and apes, indicating that a
certain level of lethal violence arises owing to our position within
the phylogeny of mammals. It was also similar to the percentage
seen in prehistoric bands and tribes, indicating that we were as

would predict. However, the level of lethal violence has changed

Berg2016,"Recent work on language contact between Scandinavian and Low
German during the Middle Ages widely assumes that the varieties were linguis-

hence an example of dialect contact. Two arguments that have been invoked
in support of this scenario are the lack of (1) meta-linguistic comments on flawed
understanding, and (2) attested bilingualism. However, towards the end of the
most intense contact period, in the early sixteenth century, there is indeed meta-
linguistic information in the preserved sources suggesting that intelligibility was
restricted. Furthermore, there are also examples of code-switching and active
bilingualism indicating that the varieties were clearly perceived as distinct
languages. This paper presents such examples from Norwegian primary sources
that have not been observed in recent scholarship. Based on this evidence, it is
argued that the relationship between the languages by the early sixteenth
century was asymmetric, Scandinavians being able to understand Low German
more often than vice versa.","Scandinavian, Low German, language contact, multlingualism, code-switching, mutual intelligibility"
Berg2016,"A crucial issue regarding the medieval contact situation has been the question of
whether the varieties involved should be considered different languages or
dialects. This question might be rephrased as follows (Trudgill 2000): where
on the continuum between these extremes was the linguistic reality located, i. e.
to what degree were the varieties mutually intelligible?",-

relationship between contemporary Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish (and dia-

scholars have used different terms, and I shall use receptive multilingualism
here (cf. Braunmüller 2012: 95 on the different terms). No speaker of any
language is oblivious to variation, as everyone is exposed to different dialects
and registers. As an extension of this, incomplete understanding of a similar
variety may develop into some form of passive or receptive multilingualism,
where speakers learn to understand the other variety through their own compe-

ism in written records, as will become evident.","receptive multilingualism, semi-communication, definition, terminology, language variation"

Swedish and Danish better than vice versa, probably because the widespread
use of dialects in Norway makes them used to linguistic variation (cf. Gooskens

be asymmetric, as demonstrated by Frinsel et al. (2015) for Swedish and Danish;

population size and language vitality is particularly relevant in the Indonesian context,

less likely to simultaneously shift away from the L1, size alone cannot predict whether
robust intergenerational transmission is occurring. Rather a clearer understanding of the

Reconstruction studies of Old Chinese (OC hereafter) and Proto Sino-Tibetan (PST hereafter) have yielded numerous significant discoveries related to the phonological histories of these two ancient languages. Despite recent advancements into OC and PST phonological histories, a few mysteries remain yet unsolved. One such mystery, the ‘stop coda’ problem, is as hotly debated now as it was when it was first raised seventy years ago. This long-running debate focuses on the existence and identity of the ‘stop codas’ in OC and in its parent language, PST. One reason why this debate has failed to reach a satisfactory conclusion is that the reconstruction methodology is limited, which assumes the Neogrammarian law of sound change. This law holds that sound change occurs without exception in every form that meets the structural description. Although this law applies to many sound changes in myriad world languages, it is not the only possible pathway of sound change. In this paper, I will argue that the key to the ‘stop-coda’ problem of OC belongs to another sound change type — lexical diffusion.

The organization of the paper is as follows. In Part One, I will introduce the background of the debate over the ‘stop codas’ in OC. Part Two reviews previous opposing analyses of the ‘stop coda’ debate. Part Three details my proposal for a lexical diffusion analysis of the ‘stop coda’ problem based on internal evidence in Chinese. Part Four investigates the problem using the Comparative Method based on external evidence from Tibetan and loan words from Chinese to Sino-Japanese. In Part Five, I will present my solution to the ‘stop coda’ problem, which is based on the analysis in the two preceding sections. Finally, in Part Six, I will discuss the general methodology of phonological reconstruction in light of the sound change mechanism.

  Song reviews two previous proposals (1) 'the voiced stop coda hypothesis' and (2) 'the
  open syllable hypothesis' to explain these data and she fnds them both wanting. She ofers a
  new proposal that employs a the reconstruction of voiced and voiceless stop fnals (exactly
  opposite in distribution to those in the system of Li Fang-kuei) in the ancestor of Chinese and
  Tibetan, with the lexical difusion of the loss of the inherited voiceless series paradoxically
  both at the time of the script's invention and during the time of the 詩經 Shījīng compilation,
  explaining the relevant oddities in phonetic series and rhyme practice. The comparison of
  Tibetan voiced fnals with Chinese voiceless fnals serves as a keystone to her argument.","Old Chinese, linguistic reconstruction"
Feder1995,"We first consider the problem of partitioning the edges of a graph G into bipartite cliques such the total order of the cliques is minimized, where the order of a clique is the number of vertices in it. It is shown that the problem is NP-complete. We then prove the existence of a partition of small total order in a sufficiently dense graph and devise an efficient algorithm to compute such a partition and the running time. Next, we define the notion of a compression of a graph G and use the result on graph partitioning to efficiently compute an optimal compression for graphs of a given size. An interesting application of the graph compression result arises from the fact that several graph algorithms can be adapted to work with the compressed representation of the input graph, thereby improving the bound on their running times, particularly on dense graphs. This makes use of the trade-off result we obtain from our partitioning algorithm. The algorithms analyzed include those for matchings, vertex connectivity, edge connectivity, and shortest paths. In each case, we improve upon the running times of the best-known algorithms for these problems.","clique, networks, algorithms, NP-complete"

**Arbitrariness**

As noted above, Aristotle’s doctrine of arbitrariness of the linguistic sign —
thus arbitrariness of cross-language diversity — pertained only to the semiotic re-

with Saussure as their reigning authority, unreflectively extended the doctrine to
grammar. [...]

langue — and the manifest behavior — parole. [...] [pb]



**Segregation: Synchrony vs. diachrony**

Saussure’s third firewall, just as essential to the Platonic enterprise, is the doc-
trine of segregation, this time between synchrony, the product, and diachrony, the
process that gave it birth. [...]

It is of course worth noting that Saussure’s two idealizations, langue ex parole
and synchrony ex diachrony, are hopelessly intertwined, being the Siamese twins
of the same Platonic philosophical impulse.

The source of variation in biological populations is both genetic (genotypic)
and non-genetic (phenotypic, epigenetic, behavioral). While both can be adaptive, it was earlier assumed that only genetic variation had direct evolutionary
consequences. However, the adaptive interaction of genes with the environment
— natural selection — is mediated by the phenotype’s structural and behavioral
traits, which are only partially controlled by genes. As a result, non-genetic variation does partake in the actual mechanism of adaptive selection. Put another way,
synchronic variation in behavior — the adaptive experimentation of individuals

Gschwind2015,"In social network analysis (SNA), relationships between members of a network are encoded in an undirected
graph where vertices represent the members of the network and edges indicate the existence of a relationship.
One important task in SNA is community detection, that is, clustering the members into communities such
that relatively few edges are in the cutsets but relatively many are internal edges. The clustering is intended
to reveal hidden or reproduce known features of the network, while the structure of communities is arbitrary.
We propose decomposing a graph into the minimum number of relaxed cliques as a new method for commu-
nity detection especially conceived for cases in which the internal structure of the community is important.
Cliques, that is, subgraphs with pairwise connected vertices, can model perfectly cohesive communities, but
often they are overly restrictive because many real communities form dense but not complete subgraphs.
Therefore, different variants of relaxed cliques have been defined in terms of vertex degree and distance, edge
density, and connectivity. They allow to impose application-specific constraints a community has to fulfill
such as familiarity and reachability among members and robustness of the communities. Standard com-
pact formulations fail in finding optimal solutions even for small instances of such decomposition problems.
Hence, we develop exact algorithms based on Dantzig-Wolfe reformulation and branch-and-price techniques.
Extensive computational results demonstrate the effectiveness of all components of the algorithms and the
validity of our approach when applied to social network instances from the literature.","clique, community detection, social network analysis (SNA), relaxed clique"

Pathmanathan2016,"**Motivation:** The remodeling of genes by shuffling, fusion, fission of genetic fragments and de novo DNA synthesis contrib-
ute to the creation and diversification of gene families. Therefore, genetic sequences show similarity with one another for
diverse reasons, i.e. common ancestry producing homology, and/or partial sharing of component fragments. These processes
must be disentangled to understand the rules and constraints on gene evolution. This task is especially challenging in large
molecular datasets, since computational analyses remain a bottleneck. We used microbial environmental data to test whether
the evolutionary processes affecting gene remodeling in polluted environments obeyed some detectable rules.

**Results:** We developed CompositeSearch, a memory-efficient, fast and scalable method to detect composite gene families in
large datasets (typically in the range of several million sequences). CompositeSearch generalizes the use of similarity net-
works to detect composite and component gene families with a greater recall, accuracy, and precision than recent programs
(FusedTriplets and MosaicFinder). Moreover, CompositeSearch provides user-friendly quality descriptions regarding the
distribution and primary sequence conservation of these gene families allowing critical biological analyses of these data. We
applied CompositeSearch to a dataset of 3,906,323 environmental sequences from 3 increasingly polluted sites. We report
that increasingly polluted samplings sites present increasing percentages of composite genes, while the rules of functional
associations of their components remains identical between sites.","community detection, composite genes, algorithms, gene similarity network"

each “gene domain”, CompositeSearch computes an average position for

Mills2013,"MOTIVATION:

Sequence similarity searches performed with BLAST, SSEARCH and FASTA achieve high sensitivity by using scoring matrices (e.g. BLOSUM62) that target low identity (<33%) alignments. Although such scoring matrices can effectively identify distant homologs, they can also produce local alignments that extend beyond the homologous regions.

RESULTS:

We measured local alignment start/stop boundary accuracy using a set of queries where the correct alignment boundaries were known, and found that 7% of BLASTP and 8% of SSEARCH alignment boundaries were overextended. Overextended alignments include non-homologous sequences; they occur most frequently between sequences that are more closely related (>33% identity). Adjusting the scoring matrix to reflect the identity of the homologous sequence can correct higher identity overextended alignment boundaries. In addition, the scoring matrix that produced a correct alignment could be reliably predicted based on the sequence identity seen in the original BLOSUM62 alignment. Realigning with the predicted scoring matrix corrected 37% of all overextended alignments, resulting in more correct alignments than using BLOSUM62 alone.","scoring matrix, BLOSUM, sequence alignment, BLAST"

Ku2016,"Background: The literature harbors many claims for lateral gene transfer (LGT) from prokaryotes to eukaryotes.
Such claims are typically founded in analyses of genome sequences. It is undisputed that many genes entered the
eukaryotic lineage via the origin of mitochondria and the origin of plastids. Claims for lineage-specific LGT to
eukaryotes outside the context of organelle origins and claims of continuous LGT to eukaryotic lineages are more
problematic. If eukaryotes acquire genes from prokaryotes continuously during evolution, then sequenced
eukaryote genomes should harbor evidence for recent LGT, like prokaryotic genomes do.

Results: Here we devise an approach to investigate 30,358 eukaryotic sequences in the context of 1,035,375
prokaryotic homologs among 2585 phylogenetic trees containing homologs from prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
Prokaryote genomes reflect a continuous process of gene acquisition and inheritance, with abundant recent
acquisitions showing 80–100 % amino acid sequence identity to their phylogenetic sister-group homologs from
other phyla. By contrast, eukaryote genomes show no evidence for either continuous or recent gene acquisitions
from prokaryotes. We find that, in general, genes in eukaryotic genomes that share ≥70 % amino acid identity to
prokaryotic homologs are genome-specific; that is, they are not found outside individual genome assemblies.

Conclusions: Our analyses indicate that eukaryotes do not acquire genes through continual LGT like prokaryotes
do. We propose a 70 % rule: Coding sequences in eukaryotic genomes that share more than 70 % amino acid
sequence identity to prokaryotic homologs are most likely assembly or annotation artifacts. The findings further
uncover that the role of differential loss in eukaryote genome evolution has been vastly underestimated.","biological evolution, evolutionary biology, contamination, errors, data problems"

Korn2016,"Relations within the Iranian branch of Indo-European have traditionally
been modelled by a tree that is essentially composed of binary splits into sub- and
sub-subbranches. The first part of this article will argue against this tree and show
that it is rendered outdated by new data that have come to light from contemporary
and ancient languages. The tree was also methodologically problematic from the
outset, both for reasons of the isoglosses on which it is based, and for not taking
into account distinctions such as shared innovations vs. shared archaisms. The
second part of the paper will present an attempt at an alternative tree for Iranian by
proposing a subbranch which I will call “Central Iranian”. Such a branch seems to
be suggested by a set of non-trivial morphological innovations shared by Bactrian,
Parthian and some neighbouring languages. The reconstruction of the nominal
system of Central Iranian which will then be proposed aims to show the result one
arrives at when trying to reconstruct a subbranch as strictly bottom-up as possible,
i. e. using only the data from the languages under study, and avoiding profitting
from Old Iranian data and from our knowledge about the proto-languages.","Indo-Iranian, family tree, subgrouping,"
Boc2010a,"Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is one of the main mechanisms driving the evolution of microorganisms. Its
accurate identification is one of the major challenges posed by reticulate evolution. In this article, we describe a new
polynomial-time algorithm for inferring HGT events and compare 3 existing and 1 new tree comparison indices in the
context of HGT identification. The proposed algorithm can rely on different optimization criteria, including least squares
(LS), Robinson and Foulds (RF) distance, quartet distance (QD), and bipartition dissimilarity (BD), when searching for
an optimal scenario of subtree prune and regraft (SPR) moves needed to transform the given species tree into the given
gene tree. As the simulation results suggest, the algorithmic strategy based on BD, introduced in this article, generally
provides better results than those based on LS, RF, and QD. The BD-based algorithm also proved to be more accurate
and faster than a well-known polynomial time heuristic RIATA-HGT. Moreover, the HGT recovery results yielded by BD
were generally equivalent to those provided by the exponential-time algorithm LatTrans, but a clear gain in running time
was obtained using the new algorithm. Finally, a statistical framework for assessing the reliability of obtained HGTs by
bootstrap analysis is also presented.","lateral gene transfer, borrowing detection, gene tree reconciliation"

Ballouz2010,"Genes encoding proteins in a common pathway are often found near each other along bacterial chromosomes. Several
explanations have been proposed to account for the evolution of these structures. For instance, natural selection may
directly favour gene clusters through a variety of mechanisms, such as increased efficiency of coregulation. An alternative
and controversial hypothesis is the selfish operon model, which asserts that clustered arrangements of genes are more
easily transferred to other species, thus improving the prospects for survival of the cluster. According to another hypothesis
(the persistence model), genes that are in close proximity are less likely to be disrupted by deletions. Here we develop
computational models to study the conditions under which gene clusters can evolve and persist. First, we examine the
selfish operon model by re-implementing the simulation and running it under a wide range of conditions. Second, we
introduce and study a Moran process in which there is natural selection for gene clustering and rearrangement occurs by
genome inversion events. Finally, we develop and study a model that includes selection and inversion, which tracks the
occurrence and fixation of rearrangements. Surprisingly, gene clusters fail to evolve under a wide range of conditions.
Factors that promote the evolution of gene clusters include a low number of genes in the pathway, a high population size,
and in the case of the selfish operon model, a high horizontal transfer rate. The computational analysis here has shown that
the evolution of gene clusters can occur under both direct and indirect selection as long as certain conditions hold. Under
these conditions the selfish operon model is still viable as an explanation for the evolution of gene clusters.","gene clusters, selfish operon theory, simulation studies, protein evolution"
Cooper2001,"The problem of finding the dominators in a control-flow graph has a long history in the
literature. The original algorithms suffered from a large asymptotic complexity but were
easy to understand. Subsequent work improved the time bound, but generally sacrificed
both simplicity and ease of implementation. This paper returns to a simple formulation
of dominance as a global data-flow problem. Some insights into the nature of dominance
lead to an implementation of an O(N 2 ) algorithm that runs faster, in practice, than the
classic Lengauer-Tarjan algorithm, which has a timebound of O(E ∗ log(N )). We compare
the algorithm to Lengauer-Tarjan because it is the best known and most widely used
of the fast algorithms for dominance. Working from the same implementation insights,
we also rederive (from earlier work on control dependence by Ferrante, et al.) a method
for calculating dominance frontiers that we show is faster than the original algorithm
by Cytron, et al. The aim of this paper is not to present a new algorithm, but, rather,
to make an argument based on empirical evidence that algorithms with discouraging
asymptotic complexities can be faster in practice than those more commonly employed.
We show that, in some cases, careful engineering of simple algorithms can overcome
theoretical advantages, even when problems grow beyond realistic sizes. Further, we
argue that the algorithms presented herein are intuitive and easily implemented, making
them excellent teaching tools.","dominators, graph theory, algorithm, directed network"

Song2016,"Some researchers, including Wang Li 王力 (1900–1986) and Xu Qing 徐青 (1934–),
have claimed—based on evidence provided by cursory observations of tonal arrangement—that
pre-Yongming poets also attempted to create tonal contrast effects in pentasyllabic poems. In
order to assess the validity of these claims, this study adopted a quantitative approach to the
analysis of tonal contrasts in three early pentasyllabic poem collections: the “Nineteen Ancient
Poems, ” pentasyllabic poems written by Cao Zhi 曹植 (192–232), and pentasyllabic poems
written by Xie Lingyun 謝靈運 (385–433). Unlike any previous study, the research presented in
this article interprets tonal contrast data obtained in these poems in an enriched context. The
author compares the tonal contrast rates in the poems written before the Yongming 永明 era
(483–93) to tonal contrast rates obtained from narrative texts written in the same period, as well
as to the ratios expected under the condition of random tonal arrangement. The results of these
comparisons reveal that there is no simple answer to the question of whether tonal contrast
existed in early pentasyllabic poems. Tonal contrast appears to have been in an intricate tran-
sitional stage that was likely initiated with an intuitive act of creativity rather than an intentional
manipulation of tones to obtain a particular known effect.","poetic function, tonal contrast, poetry, Hàn time, Chinese poetry, quantitative analysis"

It is inductive (data-driven) and seems to be much more reliable as the concurring method of internal reconstruction. Still it has been overlooked that each comparative reconstruction - to be innovative - has to be based on an initial premise. Such a premise is always the result of an abductive conclusion as used in internal reconstruction. Thus each comparative reconstruction has a core consisting of internal reconstruction. For syntactical reconstruction the following premise seems to be suitable: Linguistic structures and their changes obey the principles of universal grammar (e. g. the Minimalistic Program) and of grammaticalization. This premise proves fruitful for the explanation of the Early Greek augment */e-/< *h1e-. The augment can be determined as an original particle in the CP layer of the sentence. Later on it is reanalysed as a temporal particle, becomes part of the vP and underlies univerbation with the verb.","comparative method, reconstruction methodology, historical linguistics"

The only previous study correlated the number of nodes in linguistic phylogenies with branch lengths and found support for punctuated equilibrium. We replicate this result for branch lengths but find no support for punctuated equilibrium using a different, automated measure of linguistic divergence and a much larger dataset. With the automated measure, segments of trees containing more nodes show no greater divergence from an outgroup than segments containing fewer nodes.

Heath2014,"Time-calibrated species phylogenies are critical for addressing
a wide range of questions in evolutionary biology, such as those
that elucidate historical biogeography or uncover patterns of
coevolution and diversification. Because molecular sequence data
are not informative on absolute time, external data—most com-
monly, fossil age estimates—are required to calibrate estimates of
species divergence dates. For Bayesian divergence time methods,
the common practice for calibration using fossil information
involves placing arbitrarily chosen parametric distributions on in-
ternal nodes, often disregarding most of the information in the
fossil record. We introduce the “fossilized birth–death” (FBD) pro-
cess—a model for calibrating divergence time estimates in a Bayes-

fossils are part of the same macroevolutionary process. Under this
model, absolute node age estimates are calibrated by a single
diversification model and arbitrary calibration densities are not
necessary. Moreover, the FBD model allows for inclusion of all
available fossils. We performed analyses of simulated data and
show that node age estimation under the FBD model results in
robust and accurate estimates of species divergence times with
realistic measures of statistical uncertainty, overcoming major lim-
itations of standard divergence time estimation methods. We used
this model to estimate the speciation times for a dataset com-

nisms like argumentation, ostensive communication, or selective trust, whose
evolved or habitual function may not be the faithful reproduction of ideas or
behaviours. Second, I explain why the distinction between context biases and
content biases might not always be the best way to capture the interactions between
culture and cognition. Lastly, I show that cultural attraction models cannot be
reduced to a model of guided variation, which posits a clear separation between
individual and social learning processes. With cultural attraction, the same cognitive
mechanisms underlie both innovation and the preservation of traditions.","cultural evolution, cultural attraction theory, evolutionary theory, "
Ferrada2008,"Recent laboratory experiments suggest that a molecule’s ability to evolve neutrally is important for its
ability to generate evolutionary innovations. In contrast to laboratory experiments, life unfolds on time-
scales of billions of years. Here, we ask whether a molecule’s ability to evolve neutrally—a measure of its
robustness—facilitates evolutionary innovation also on these large time-scales. To this end, we use protein
designability, the number of sequences that can adopt a given protein structure, as an estimate of the
structure’s ability to evolve neutrally. Based on two complementary measures of functional diversity—
catalytic diversity and molecular functional diversity in gene ontology—we show that more robust proteins
have a greater capacity to produce functional innovations. Significant associations among structural
designability, folding rate and intrinsic disorder also exist, underlining the complex relationship of the
structural factors that affect protein evolution.","robustness, protein structure, protein evolution"
Divjak2016,"Most studies in Cognitive Linguistics are based on data from one language. There is a
strong bias towards Indo-European languages, and to English in particular. At the
same time, there have been quite a few notable exceptions. Particularly fruitful has
been the collaboration between Cognitive Linguistics and semantic and lexical
typology, which goes back to the famous study of Basic Colour Terms by Berlin
and @Kay<1969> (1969). Abundant cross-linguistic co-lexification data, which have become
available recently (e. g., List et al. 2014), allow the linguist to identify the most
common semantic extensions and compare how languages “carve up” different
semantic domains. A concise overview of this research area is presented in
@KoptjevskajaTamm<2015> (2015). The grammatical pole has enjoyed less attention.

Hilpert2015,"At first blush it may seem odd that researchers in Cognitive Linguistics should have an
interest in the historical development of language. After all, analyzing the relationship
between language and cognition seems a much more feasible task if there are speakers
whose behavior can be observed in the here-and-now. This of course is not possible with
languages or language varieties that are no longer spoken. To give just two examples,
one cannot conduct a lexical decision task with speakers of Old English, nor is it possible
to study the metaphorical underpinnings of gestures that accompanied conversations in
Hittite. How can a cognitive approach to language history be anything but utter specula-

ly in line with the cognitive linguistic enterprise, but that furthermore an understanding
of how language change works is a necessary prerequisite for an adequate theory of how
language and cognition are related in synchrony. The key idea underpinning this argu-
ment is the usage-based approach to language, that is, the hypothesis that language use
shapes speakers’ cognitive representation of language.","cognitive linguistics, historical linguistics, introduction"

Hinze2010,"Background: Much work in systems biology, but also in the analysis of social network and communication and
transport infrastructure, involves an in-depth analysis of local and global properties of those networks, and how these
properties relate to the function of the network within the integrated system. Most often, systematic controls for such
networks are difficult to obtain, because the features of the network under study are thought to be germane to that
function. In most such cases, a surrogate network that carries any or all of the features under consideration, while
created artificially and in the absence of any selective pressure relating to the function of the network being studied,
would be of considerable interest.

Results: Here, we present an algorithmic model for growing networks with a broad range of biologically and
technologically relevant degree distributions using only a small set of parameters. Specifying network connectivity via
an assortativity matrix allows us to grow networks with arbitrary degree distributions and arbitrary modularity. We
show that the degree distribution is controlled mainly by the ratio of node to edge addition probabilities, and the
probability for node duplication. We compare topological and functional modularity measures, study their
dependence on the number and strength of modules, and introduce the concept of anti-modularity: a property of
networks in which nodes from one functional group preferentially do not attach to other nodes of that group. We also
investigate global properties of networks as a function of the network's growth parameters, such as smallest path
length, correlation coefficient, small-world-ness, and the nature of the percolation phase transition. We search the
space of networks for those that are most like some well-known biological examples, and analyze the biological
significance of the parameters that gave rise to them.

Conclusions: Growing networks with specified characters (degree distribution and modularity) provides the
opportunity to create surrogates for biological and technological networks, and to test hypotheses about the
processes that gave rise to them. We find that many celebrated network properties may be a consequence of the way
in which these networks grew, rather than a necessary consequence of how they work or function.","network modularity, measure, "

Gaizauskas1977,"Given an information extraction (IE) system that performs
an extraction task against texts in one language, it is natural to con-
sider how to modify the system to perform the same task against texts
in a different language. More generally, there may be a requirement to
do the extraction task against texts in an arbitrary number of differ-
ent languages and to present results to a user who has no knowledge
of the source language from which the information has been extracted.
To minimise the language-specific alterations that need to be made in
extending the system to a new language, it is important to separate
the task-specific conceptual knowledge the system uses, which may be
assumed to be language independent, from the language-dependent lexi-
cal knowledge the system requires, which unavoidably must be extended
for each new language. In this paper we describe how the architecture
of the LaSIE system, an IE system designed to do monolingual extrac-
tion from English texts, has been modified to support a clean separation
between conceptual and lexical information. This separation allows hard-
to-acquire, domain-specific conceptual knowledge to be represented only
once, and hence to be reused in extracting information from texts in mul-
tiple languages, while standard lexical resources can be used to extend
language coverage. Preliminary experiments with extending the system
to French are described.","multilingual information extraction, concepticon, lexicon"
Gaizauskas1977,"We discuss several alternative approaches to constructing a multilinguM IE

is based on the assumption that it is possible, when dealing with a particular
domain or application, to construct a language-independent representation of
concepts relevant to the domain. We call this representation a domain model
or concepticon. This unaesthetic neologism is advanced on rhetorical grounds:
our proposal is that it is both possible and sensible to represent some (natural)
language-independent conceptual content separately from language-specific in-
formation about particular lexical items. If the latter belongs in a lexicon (which [pb]
must, by any reasonable definition, be language-specific) then the former belongs
in its own repository for which it is useful to employ an equally compelling term.
Decoupling what many authors would refer to as ""lexical semantics"" from the
lexicon, makes it possible to construct a system in which entries in multiple
language-specific lexicons stand in a many-to-many relation with entries in a
common concepticon. It is this architecture that makes multilingual IE possi-

Nantong; 2. Of all the consonant initials, nasal consonants are most likely (m- being
more likely than n-) to lower the following high back vowel u; 3. In terms of

following order: first in front of mid front vowels, then u# itself becoming vu#, and
finally in front of the low back vowel /A/ in closed syllable while u/A/# remains
unaffected; 4. -i is more likely than -y to maintain the difference between ts- and th-; 5.

Initially, both mutation rate and lateral gene transfer levels were elevated. The latter was pandemic and pervasive to the extent that it, not vertical inheritance, defined the evolutionary dynamic. As increasingly complex and precise biological structures and processes evolved, both the mutation rate and the scope and level of lateral gene transfer, i.e., evolutionary temperature, dropped, and the evolutionary dynamic gradually became that characteristic of modern cells. The various subsystems of the cell “crystallized,” i.e., became refractory to lateral gene transfer, at different stages of “cooling,” with the translation apparatus probably crystallizing first. Organismal lineages, and so organisms as we know them, did not exist at these early stages. The universal phylogenetic tree, therefore, is not an organismal tree at its base but gradually becomes one as its peripheral branchings emerge. The universal ancestor is not a discrete entity. It is, rather, a diverse community of cells that survives and evolves as a biological unit. This communal ancestor has a physical history but not a genealogical one.

Yanai2002,"**BACKGROUND**
Comparative genomics provides at least three methods beyond traditional sequence similarity for identifying functional links between genes: the examination of common phylogenetic distributions, the analysis of conserved proximity along the chromosomes of multiple genomes, and observations of fusions of genes into a multidomain gene in another organism. We have previously generated the links according to each of these methods individually for 43 known microbial genomes. Here we combine these results to construct networks of functional associations.

**RESULTS**

We show that the functional networks obtained by applying these methods have different topologies and that the information they provide is largely additive. In particular, the combined networks of functional links contain an average of 57% of an organism's complete genetic complement, uncover substantial portions of known pathways, and suggest the function of previously unannotated genes. In addition, the combined networks are qualitatively different from the networks obtained using individual methods. They have a dominant cluster that contains approximately 80%-90% of the genes, independent of genome size, and the dominant clusters show the small world behavior expected of a biological system, with global connectivity that is nearly random, and local properties that are highly ordered.

**CONCLUSIONS**

Hurles2003,"Human expansion into the far reaches of the Pacific has occurred within the past 3000–4000 years. This is so recent that it is arguably the best opportunity to test models of the origin and dispersal of human groups and their domesticated plants and animals, cultural and linguistic evolution, human impacts on a pristine environment, and the lower limits for a long-term sustainable population. Multidisciplinary research is essential because these models must account for archaeological, ecological, cultural, historical, social, linguistic and (both mitochondrial and nuclear) genetic data.

Falk1999,"Women have been a dynamic force in American linguistics, yet this has not
always been apparent in current histories of linguistics. For twentieth century
linguistics, Julia S.Falk argues, the same story has been told over and over: a
story of leading men, their followers, and their interest in language as a
structure observable in patterns of the distribution of forms.
This book challenges this received history by presenting a much-needed
reevaluation of twentieth century American linguistics which focuses on the
contributions of women to our modern understanding of language. This book
relates an account of linguistics as perceived and experienced by three
American women in the first half of the twentieth century. Alice Vanderbilt
Morris dreamed of creating a new auxiliary language for international
communication, and brought together professional linguists and members of
the New York upper class to achieve her goal. Gladys Amanda Reichard
devoted her life to the study of Native American languages; despite opposition
from men who claimed the territory, her studies still survive. And E.Adelaide
Hahn brought themes of modern linguistics to the study of Latin and Hittite,
keeping her colleagues mindful of ancient and classical languages.
Rather than the standard American story of an increasingly triumphant
march of scientific inquiry towards structural phonology, Women, Language and
Linguistics reveals a linguistics where the purpose of language was
communication; the appeal of languages lay in their diversity; and the authority
of language resided with its speakers and writers. Julia S.Falk explores the vital
part which women have played in preserving a linguistics based on the reality
and experience of language; this book finally brings to light a neglected
perspective for those working in linguistics and the history of linguistics.","feminism, linguistics, history of science"

editions produced with a single copy-text regained the academic prestige that Gaston Paris›

Gil2016,"Many linguists maintain that the grammars of different languages are
incommensurable. This poses the problem of how to compare them. One pro-
posed solution is to distinguish between descriptive categories for individual
languages and comparative categories for crosslinguistic comparisons. At the
same time, it is also commonly assumed that language-internal variation can be
described in a unitary manner, thereby presupposing that different dialects of
the same language are commensurable. However, it is well known that the
language-dialect distinction is not categorical but rather forms a continuum.
This raises the question: Where lies the boundary between commensurability
and incommensurability? This question is best addressed in terms of the notion
of languoid, a cover term that includes languages, smaller entities such as
dialects and registers, but also larger assemblages such as genealogical and
areal groupings. This article proposes replacing the notion of language-specific
descriptive category with that of languoid-associated descriptive category. Since
languoids can be of arbitrary size, such categories may form the basis for
crosslinguistic comparisons, alongside comparative categories. What this
means is that different languoids, regardless of how close or distant they are
to each other, may be commensurable with respect to some linguistic features
but incommensurable with regard to others.","language comparison, comparison concepts, comparative categories, typology, languoid, doculect, language variation, "

LT. In particular, the language-dialect continuum points towards a refinement
of the distinction between language-specific descriptive categories and comparative concepts proposed by Haspelmath (2010, 2015, 2016), allowing for the
possibility that descriptive categories observable in particular languages may
also form the basis for crosslinguistic comparisons. This article thus goes some
of the way towards answering the questions posed by Moravcsik (2016), in this
issue, especially that pertaining to the “validity domain of categories and

Skoglund2016,"The appearance of people associated with the Lapita culture in
the South Pacific around 3,000 years ago 1 marked the beginning
of the last major human dispersal to unpopulated lands. However,
the relationship of these pioneers to the long-established Papuan
people of the New Guinea region is unclear. Here we present
genome-wide ancient DNA data from three individuals from
Vanuatu (about 3,100–2,700 years before present) and one from
Tonga (about 2,700–2,300 years before present), and analyse them
with data from 778 present-day East Asians and Oceanians. Today,
indigenous people of the South Pacific harbour a mixture of ancestry
from Papuans and a population of East Asian origin that no longer
exists in unmixed form, but is a match to the ancient individuals.
Most analyses have interpreted the minimum of twenty-five per
cent Papuan ancestry in the region today as evidence that the
first humans to reach Remote Oceania, including Polynesia, were
derived from population mixtures near New Guinea, before their
further expansion into Remote Oceania 2–5 . However, our finding
that the ancient individuals had little to no Papuan ancestry implies
that later human population movements spread Papuan ancestry

But this approach won’t work, because we are not the

OHara1996,"""The Natural System"" is the name given to the underlying arrangement present in the diversity of life. Unlike a classification, which is made up of classes and members, a system or arrangement is an integrated whole made up of connected parts. In the pre-evolutionary period a variety of forms were proposed for the Natural System, including maps, circles, stars, and abstract multidimensional objects. The trees sketched by Darwin in the 1830s should probably be considered the first genuine evolutionary diagrams of the Natural System — the first genuine evolutionary trees. Darwin refined his image of the Natural System in the well-known evolutionary tree published in the Origin of Species, where he also carefully distinguished between arrangements and classifications. Following the publication of the Origin, there was a great burst of evolutionary tree building, but interest in trees declined substantially after 1900, only to be revived in recent years with the development of cladistic analysis.

While evolutionary trees are modern diagrams of the Natural System, they are at the same time instances of another broad class of diagrams that may be called ""trees of history"": branching diagrams of genealogical descent and change. During the same years that Darwin was sketching his first evolutionary trees, the earliest examples of two other trees of history also appeared: the first trees of language evolution and of manuscript genealogy. Though these were apparently independent of evolutionary trees in their origin, the similarities among all these trees of history, and among the historical processes that underlie them, were soon recognized. Darwin compared biological evolution and language evolution several times in the Origin of Species, and both Ernst Haeckel and the linguist August Schleicher made similar comparisons. Both linguists and stemmaticists (students of manuscript descent) understood the principle of apomorphy — the principle that only shared innovations provide evidence of common ancestry — more clearly than did systematists, and if there had been more cross-fertilization among these fields the cladistic revolution in systematics might well have taken place in the nineteenth century.

Although historical linguists and stemmaticists have in some respects had sounder theory than have systematists, at least until recently, they have also had the practical problem of very large amounts of data, a problem not often faced by systematists until the advent of molecular sequencing. The opportunity now exists for systematists to contribute to the theory and practice of linguistics and stemmatics, their sister disciplines in historical reconstruction, through application of our commonly used computer programs for tree estimation. Preliminary results from the application of numerical cladistic analysis to a large stemmatic data set have been very encouraging, and have already generated much discussion in the stemmatics community.","history of science, stemmatics, family tree, systematics, cladistics, philology,"
Montemurro2016,"In written language, the choice of specific words is constrained by both
grammatical requirements and the specific semantic context of the message to be trans-
mitted. To a significant degree, the semantic context is in turn affected by a broad cultural
and historical environment, which also influences matters of style and manners. Over time,
those environmental factors leave an imprint in the statistics of language use, with some
words becoming more common and other words being preferred less. Here we characterize
the patterns of language use over time based on word statistics extracted from more than 4.5
million books written over a period of 308 years. We find evidence of novel systematic
oscillatory patterns in word use with a consistent period narrowly distributed around 14
years. The specific phase relationships between different words show structure at two
independent levels: first, there is a weak global phase modulation that is primarily linked to
overall shifts in the vocabulary across time; and second, a stronger component dependent on
well defined semantic relationships between words. In particular, complex network analysis
reveals that semantically related words show strong phase coherence. Ultimately, these
previously unknown patterns in the statistics of language may be a consequence of changes
in the cultural framework that influences the thematic focus of writers.","word frequency, Google N-Grams, lexical change, computational linguistics, automatic approach"

Frankland2015,"The 18th-century Prussian philosopher Wilhelm von Humbolt famously noted that natural language makes “infinite use of finite means.” By this, he meant that language deploys a finite set of words to express an effectively infinite set of ideas. As the seat of both language and thought, the human brain must be capable of rapidly encoding the multitude of thoughts that a sentence could convey. How does this work? Here, we find evidence supporting a long-standing conjecture of cognitive science: that the human brain encodes the meanings of simple sentences much like a computer, with distinct neural populations representing answers to basic questions of meaning such as “Who did it?” and “To whom was it done?”

Human brains flexibly combine the meanings of words to compose structured thoughts. For example, by combining the meanings of “bite,” “dog,” and “man,” we can think about a dog biting a man, or a man biting a dog. Here, in two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments using multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA), we identify a region of left mid-superior temporal cortex (lmSTC) that flexibly encodes “who did what to whom” in visually presented sentences. We find that lmSTC represents the current values of abstract semantic variables (“Who did it?” and “To whom was it done?”) in distinct subregions. Experiment 1 first identifies a broad region of lmSTC whose activity patterns (i) facilitate decoding of structure-dependent sentence meaning (“Who did what to whom?”) and (ii) predict affect-related amygdala responses that depend on this information (e.g., “the baby kicked the grandfather” vs. “the grandfather kicked the baby”). Experiment 2 then identifies distinct, but neighboring, subregions of lmSTC whose activity patterns carry information about the identity of the current “agent” (“Who did it?”) and the current “patient” (“To whom was it done?”). These neighboring subregions lie along the upper bank of the superior temporal sulcus and the lateral bank of the superior temporal gyrus, respectively. At a high level, these regions may function like topographically defined data registers, encoding the fluctuating values of abstract semantic variables. This functional architecture, which in key respects resembles that of a classical computer, may play a critical role in enabling humans to flexibly generate complex thoughts.","semantics, neurology, neurolinguistics, sentence meaning, meaning, conceptualization"

At higher levels rhyme pairs (or n-some) and fixed forms (sonnet, rondel, etc.) are annotated. Here we will focus on components providing phonetic and metrical annotation: (1) the F-component, whose task is to derive the phonetic transcription from the input data, (2) the G-component, whose task is to generate a set of all possible metrical interpretations of these data, and (3) the M-component, whose task is to select from this set the final interpretation.

did not lead to a large-scale geographic expansion of Bantu-speaking village communities in Central Africa. An
extensive and rapid expansion of Bantu-speech communities, along with the dispersal of cereal cultivation and
metallurgy, occurred only when the core of the Central African forest block was affected around 2500 BP. We claim

The need to consider more than one exclusively shared innovation in establishing a subgroup arises when we attempt to demonstrate that a language boundary
appeared in the dissolution of the proto-language of the family, a boundary that
included what today appear as different languages. It is of course conceivable
that a single exclusively shared innovation is the sole remnant of such a boundary.
But the demonstration that such a boundary actually existed depends generally
on the appearance of a set of exclusively shared innovations; the mass of such
innovations, however, need only be greater than that which could be due to the
dialectal spread of innovations (whose borders now coincide as a result of later 
developments) within the proto-language. Thus teh mass and teh identity of range of sets of exclusively shared innovations in related languages determine the probability of the former existance of a language boundary.","shared innovation, cladistics, subgrouping, family tree"

be identical or nearly so to sounds in the word of the donor language.
These two go together, apparently, as a strategy for attempting to sort
loans from potential cognates in proposed cases of remote genetic

that loans bear sounds similar to the source language. And conversely,
identical or very similar sound matchings suggest borrowing and are
less trustworthy as evidence of a relationship, since true sound corre-

language change is the collection of speculative etymologies and discussion of the meaning
of letters, sounds and names in Plato’s *Cratylus*. One primary issue there is the essentialist
question of whether words have meaning by nature or by convention. Semantic change and
dialect difference are invoked as a partial argument for conventionality. There is also a claim
of monogenesis by an act of creation – names were given by some  gure in the distant past
(the ‘Legislator’). Change and variation are then seen as betrayals of this original creation.

introduction of Semitic grammatical works into Europe seems to have stimulated the serious

An early example is Theodor Bibliander’s work on Semitic (1548), which identi es Arabic
as a descendant of Hebrew (this idea was already current in the ancient Semitic grammatical
tradition), but not related to any European languages. The idea of families of independent

our subject, it might be useful to give an overall view: what did later pre-modern historical
linguistics accomplish that is part of our lasting heritage? Perhaps the most important
concepts that developed in and came to dominate nineteenth-century historical linguistics
were the following:

i Genetic relationship (strictly, common origin) can lead to sets of regular sound correspondences, and these can be turned into arboriform genealogies. [...]
ii The fact that these trees are rooted allows the construction of sequences of ancestors
receding toward the root, and eventually, in the ideal case, to recovering the root or
‘archetype’ as well as the intermediates. This is done by  nding a latest common ancestor
for a related group and then working backwards through a sequence of sub-genealogies.
This notion is still part of text criticism as well as linguistic and zoological  liation,
though now we have computational tree-making tools of huge sophistication and can
handle more data and evaluate it statistically. [...]
iii Correspondences between categories can be remetaphorised as ‘actions’, in particular within systems, which themselves emerge as metaphorisations over sets of actions. Thus one major domain of change becomes the shift of entire systems, not just individual movement from segment to segment. [...][pb]
iv The establishment of actions in time, i.e. reconstruction, as a necessary basis for filiation.  The outputs of pathways of action are new language states. In fact it is reconstruction that validates the correspondences or trees, by giving predicted data as output. This was accepted from the 1850s onwards. [...]
v The objects that are reconstructed may be ‘imaginary’ in that they are invented by the reconstructor, but this does not make them ontologically ‘unreal’. Reconstructing the ‘imaginary’ in this sense is simply the insertion of unattested but argumentatively justified objects into histories on the basis of procedural imperative, in other words allowing the disciplinary praxis to generate objects in the past. The crucial test for the validity of a reconstructed object increasingly becomes whether or not it works, ideally with maximal parsimony and naturalness, and can be rationally defended. [...]
vi The correspondences that lead to reconstruction are by and large ‘regular’: this stipulation allows the trustworthy (rational) reconstruction of protolanguages and earlier states of given languages. It also allows construction of reliable genetic trees for language families, the establishment of families and subfamilies, and reliable etymologies. [...]
vii Following from (vi). As a procedural imperative all irregularities should, if possible, be expunged by the creation of subregularities.

Hamann2014,"In this chapter, we will focus on changes in phonological systems across generations of
speakers of the same language community. In contrast to phonetic changes, which have been
dealt with in the previous chapter, phonological changes are not directly observable or
measurable, because they involve a change in the mental representations of sounds.","phonological change, sound change, definition"

of a near-merger, from Labov, Yaeger and Steiner (1972), is the vowel contrast in the word
pair *source* and *sauce*, which was thought to be pronounced the same in the vernacular of
New York City. Contrary to these expectations, Labov et al. (1972) found a statistical
difference between the acoustic realisations of the two vowels, though the speakers could not
perceptually differentiate them. Based on their  findings, Labov et al. suggest that such a
sound change is happening when two sounds perceptually merge into one, but due to the
consistent articulatory differentiation the phonemes stay separate, and their phonetic
realisations move apart again in the following generations. In a later study, Labov et al.
(1991: 45) observed considerable individual variation within the community that shows such
near-merges.","phoneme merger, sound change, perception, language change,"

syntactic reconstruction, an aversion which is still found among many contemporary historical
syntacticians. This view is gradually changing, however, and more and more concurrent
linguists are arguing for the feasibility of syntactic reconstruction. Particularly within the
framework of Construction Grammar it has been argued that syntactic reconstruction is not
only achievable, but may also be quite successful. In addition, historical syntacticians from a
diversity of frameworks have started coming forward to propose different methods of
syntactic reconstructions within their respective models.","syntactic reconstruction, linguistic reconstruction, language change, syntax, introduction"
Urban2014,"The topic of this chapter is lexical semantic change, the change of the meaning of languages’
lexical items through time. To give a  rst idea of this process by example, the basic meaning
of Old High German bein was ‘bone’ (the original or source meaning), while in Modern
German, it is ‘leg’ (the innovative or target meaning). In this example, there is a complete
change in meaning, with the original meaning disappearing almost entirely. However,
arguably, semantic change is also present if the original meaning persists and a new one is
merely added, since already then there is a difference from the original state.","semantic reconstruction, introduction, semantic change, lexical change"
Urban2014,"The introductory example showed that German bein underwent semantic change from the
original basic meaning ‘bone’ to ‘leg’. In the older stages of other West and North Germanic
languages, ‘bone’ is uniformly found as the general meaning of bein’s cognates (Orel 2003:
32). 2 If this is true, positing an original meaning ‘leg’ requires the assumption of a change at
many nodes of the family tree, while positing an original meaning ‘bone’ necessitates only
change at a low node of the tree. By the principle of parsimony, then, reconstructing ‘bone’
would be preferred on methodological grounds. Therefore, if we did not already know from
the available internal evidence regarding the development of German that ‘bone’ is the likely
original meaning, the comparative evidence would direct us towards the same conclusion.","semantic change, semantic reconstruction, parsimony, family tree"
Mailhammer2014,"This chapter gives an overview of what etymology is, what it engages in and what issues are
under debate, focusing on the following key points. First, etymology is both the foundation of
historical linguistics, the starting point of the historical investigation of a language and at the
same time one of its sub elds. In order to establish the etymology of an item one must backtrack
to the chronological stage at which it was transparently formed for the  rst time, and account
for the changes it subsequently underwent. Hence, etymologies give us a view of a language’s
history. They make more general statements possible, and they are historical accounts of
individual items as well. Second, etymology is distinct from describing synchronic processes,
such as word-formation. It is an inherently diachronic perspective in relating one chronological
stage of a language to earlier ones. Third, the research questions of etymology can, in principle,
be applied to bigger and smaller linguistic units with suf cient stability, as etymology is
concerned with the origin and history of linguistic elements.","etymology, introduction, language change, evolutionary scenario"

during usage events, as language users apply cognitive processes to the task of communicating
with one another. As each usage event has an impact on users’ cognitive representations,
change can take place in both children and adults. We outline this usage-based perspective in

Hull1976,"The processes which contribute to the evolution of biological species take place at a variety of levels of organization; e.g., genes give rise to other genes, organisms give rise to other organisms, and species give rise to other species. All of these processes require continuity through descent. If species are to be units of evolution, they need not be composed of similar organisms; instead they must be made up of organisms related by descent. Taxonomists do not impose this requirement on the phenomena; rather it follows from the nature of the evolutionary process itself. In addition to spatiotemporal continuity, species must also possess a certain degree of unity to function as units of evolution. Gene exchange is one means by which such unity can be promoted. The mechanisms by which asexual species maintain a similar unity are problematic; higher taxa pose an even more serious problem. However, if species are chunks of the genealogical nexus, they cannot be viewed as classes. Instead they possess all the characteristics of individuals—that is, if organisms are taken to be paradigm individuals. The major difference between organisms and species as individuals is that organisms possess a largely fixed genetic makeup which constrains their development, whereas species do not. If species are individuals, then their names are most naturally viewed as proper names, names which denote particular individuals but do not possess any intensional meaning.

Honeybone2016,"One question that historical phonology should reasonably seek to answer is: are there impossible changes? That is: are there plausible changes that we could reasonably expect to occur in the diachrony of languages’ phonologies, but which nonetheless do not ever occur? In this paper I seek to spell out what it really means to consider this question and what we need to do in order to answer it for any specific case. This will require a consideration of some fundamental issues in historical phonology, including the distinction between exceptionless and lexically-specific/sporadic changes (which I call ‘N-changes’ and ‘A-changes’), and the connection between that distinction and the ‘misperception’ model of phonological change. It will involve an analysis of aspects of the phonological history of Pulo Annian, Arabic, Italic, Spanish and several varieties of English. I argue that the current state of evidence indicates that there are indeed impossible changes (which I symbolise using ‘x ≯ y’ to represent that ‘x cannot change into y’) in a very specific but phonologically real way, and that f ≯ θ is one.","sound change, regular sound change, methodology, phonological theory, pathways"

in DNA sequences in which gaps are present.

This apparently has consequences for parsimony principles in phylogenetic reconstruction and in general in biology and may have similar implications in linguistics, as in many cases, what we discuss, are also ""inapplicables"", as we may often tend to compare datapoins with each other which have simply never been present in a given lineage.

**Significance**

Our knowledge of the diet of early hominins derives mainly from animal skeletal remains found in archaeological sites, leading to a bias toward a protein-based diet. We report on the earliest known archive of food plants found in the superimposed Acheulian sites excavated at Gesher Benot Ya‘aqov, Israel. These remains, some 780,000 y old, comprise 55 taxa, including nuts, fruits, seeds, vegetables, and plants producing underground storage organs. They reflect a varied plant diet, staple plant foods, seasonality, and hominins’ environmental knowledge and use of fire in food processing. Our results change previous notions of paleo diet and shed light on hominin abilities to adjust to new environments and exploit different flora, facilitating population diffusion, survival, and colonization beyond Africa.

**Abstract**

Diet is central for understanding hominin evolution, adaptation, and environmental exploitation, but Paleolithic plant remains are scarce. A unique macrobotanical assemblage of 55 food plant taxa from the Acheulian site of Gesher Benot Ya‘aqov, Israel includes seeds, fruits, nuts, vegetables, and plants producing underground storage organs. The food plant remains were part of a diet that also included aquatic and terrestrial fauna. This diverse assemblage, 780,000 y old, reflects a varied plant diet, staple plant foods, environmental knowledge, seasonality, and the use of fire in food processing. It provides insight into the wide spectrum of the diet of mid-Pleistocene hominins, enhancing our understanding of their adaptation from the perspective of subsistence. Our results shed light on hominin abilities to adjust to new environments, facilitating population diffusion and colonization beyond Africa. We reconstruct the major vegetal foodstuffs, while considering the possibility of some detoxification by fire. The site, located in the Levantine Corridor through which several hominin waves dispersed out of Africa, provides a unique opportunity to study mid-Pleistocene vegetal diet and is crucial for understanding subsistence aspects of hominin dispersal and the transition from an African-based to a Eurasian diet.

Holstege2016,"Vocalizations such as mews and cries in cats or crying and laughter in humans are examples of expression of emotions. These vocalizations are generated by the emotional motor system, in which the mesencephalic periaqueductal gray (PAG) plays a central role, as demonstrated by the fact that lesions in the PAG lead to complete mutism in cats, monkeys, as well as in humans. The PAG receives strong projections from higher limbic regions and from the anterior cingulate, insula, and orbitofrontal cortical areas. In turn, the PAG has strong access to the caudal medullary nucleus retroambiguus (NRA). The NRA is the only cell group that has direct access to the motoneurons involved in vocalization, i.e., the motoneuronal cell groups innervating soft palate, pharynx, and larynx as well as diaphragm, intercostal, abdominal, and pelvic floor muscles. Together they determine the intraabdominal, intrathoracic, and subglottic pressure, control of which is necessary for generating vocalization. Only humans can speak, because, via the lateral component of the volitional or somatic motor system, they are able to modulate vocalization into words and sentences. For this modulation they use their motor cortex, which, via its corticobulbar fibers, has direct access to the motoneurons innervating the muscles of face, mouth, tongue, larynx, and pharynx. In conclusion, humans generate speech by activating two motor systems. They generate vocalization by activating the prefrontal-PAG-NRA-motoneuronal pathway, and, at the same time, they modulate this vocalization into words and sentences by activating the corticobulbar fibers to the face, mouth, tongue, larynx, and pharynx motoneurons.","human speech, language capacity, neurology, neurolinguistics"
Fitch2016,"For four decades, the inability of nonhuman primates to produce human speech sounds has been claimed to stem from limitations in their vocal tract anatomy, a conclusion based on plaster casts made from the vocal tract of a monkey cadaver. We used x-ray videos to quantify vocal tract dynamics in living macaques during vocalization, facial displays, and feeding. We demonstrate that the macaque vocal tract could easily produce an adequate range of speech sounds to support spoken language, showing that previous techniques based on postmortem samples drastically underestimated primate vocal capabilities. Our findings imply that the evolution of human speech capabilities required neural changes rather than modifications of vocal anatomy. Macaques have a speech-ready vocal tract but lack a speech-ready brain to control it.","language capacity, speech acoustics, monkeys, language origin"
Cser2016,"In the first half of the nineteenth century comparative and historical linguistics focused mainly on morphological structure. Although important phonological discoveries were made, phonology played a subsidiary role to morphology. What could be called the models of language were all theories of morphology. These speculations were targets the Neogrammarians attacked vigorously, mainly in the spirit of uniformitarianism. Phonology was different in terms of abstractness. Sounds were treated in a superficially abstract manner, but this was based on the phonetically imprecise littera-tradition, the emphasis on correspondences, the focus on dead languages, and the impact of the Indian tradition. The Neogrammarians, by contrast, strove to make phonology more phonetic and more rigorous and, paradoxically, earned the contempt of their opponents for introducing a different kind of abstractness by reconstructing a segment not attested in unchanged form in any of the Indo-European languages. In turn, while the Neogrammarians admitted that de Saussure’s analysis in the Mémoire is highly logical, they dismissed it as lacking sufficient empirical motivation. It appears that the argument reminded them of the analyses of the previous generation, and de Saussure’s formulation, which they found unduly abstract, was superficially just the kind they wanted to purge linguistics of at last.","history of science, phonology, morphology, 19th century, Neogrammarian sound change, ancestral states, unattested character states,"
Sen2016,"The life cycle of phonological processes (e.g. @BermudezOtero<2015> 2015) provides an account of how a sound change might develop over the history of a language, from its beginnings in the pressures of speaking and hearing, through its progress to a cognitively-controlled process and maturation into a categorical phenomenon, to its final resting-place as a lexical or morphological pattern. It has been the subject of increased research in recent times, but has faced strikingly few challenges to its diachronic aspects, notably its predictions of unidirectionality and cycle-based dialectal splits. Furthermore, the cognitive mechanisms rooted in morpheme-based learning which are required to predict domain narrowing (phrase > word > stem) rather than broadening need to be tested through child (and adult) acquisition studies. This paper examines how a historical phonologist might go about interrogating the life-cycle model using extensive historical data spanning several centuries, and methodically ascertaining what the model predicts in order to know what to look for. The paper concludes by briefly addressing some of the many other questions raised by the model which have faced comparatively little investigation given the purported pervasiveness of the life cycle.","life cycle, pathways, phonological change, sound change, "
Gao2016,"This study focuses on the on-going disappearance of low tone breathiness in Shanghai Chinese. In the change from a voicing contrast to a tone register contrast in Sinitic languages, the ancient voiced series was characterised by a breathy voice quality, which remained as a secondary and redundant cue of low tones in Shanghai Chinese. This study, using transversal production data from 12 young and 10 elderly speakers, shows that low tone breathiness is better preserved by elderly than young speakers, and by male than female speakers. We predict a future loss of this secondary cue, which is speeding up due to the interference with Standard Chinese. We also found that the disappearance is more advanced in female speakers, which might be explained by female speakers’ stronger adherence to Standard Chinese as the prestigious form. Indeed, our young female speakers reported more frequent usage of Standard Chinese than Shanghai Chinese and higher competence in Standard Chinese than in Shanghai Chinese, whereas young male speakers were more confident in their usage of Shanghai Chinese.","tonal change, tone language, Shanghainese, breathy voice, speech acoustics, sociolinguistic variation"

Persi2016,"Protein repeats are considered hotspots of protein evolution, associated with acquisition of new functions and novel phenotypic traits, including disease. Paradoxically, however, repeats are often strongly conserved through long spans of evolution. To resolve this conundrum, it is necessary to directly compare paralogous (horizontal) evolution of repeats within proteins with their orthologous (vertical) evolution through speciation. Here we develop a rigorous methodology to identify highly periodic repeats with significant sequence similarity, for which evolutionary rates and selection (dN/dS) can be estimated, and systematically characterize their evolution. We show that horizontal evolution of repeats is markedly accelerated compared with their divergence from orthologues in closely related species. This observation is universal across the diversity of life forms and implies a biphasic evolutionary regime whereby new copies experience rapid functional divergence under combined effects of strongly relaxed purifying selection and positive selection, followed by fixation and conservation of each individual repeat.","orthology, paralogy, protein evolution, protein repeats, protein functions"
Clackson2002,"n recent years that has been a surge of interest in Indo-European
word-formation in general, and in particular in compounding. In
the field of Latin linguistics alone there have been three books

peculiar developments in phonology (see further Rasmussen's paper

compounds can sometimes reveal much about the syntactic patterns

Lupyan2016,"Why are there different languages? A common explanation is that different
languages arise from the gradual accumulation of random changes. Here, we
argue that, beyond these random factors, linguistic differences, from sounds to
grammars, may also reflect adaptations to different environments in which the

shape language include the social, the physical, and the technological.","adaptationism, language evolution, neutral evolution, "

Lupyan2016,"A standard account of how different languages form is uncannily similar to the traditional folk
tales related by the opening quote. Languages change over time. If everyone always spoke to
everyone else, these changes might spread evenly to the entire speech community. However,
people are more likely to communicate with their neighbors, thereby ‘inheriting’ their ways of
speaking. This asymmetry means that variation within a group will become increasingly
decoupled from variation between groups, leading to the eventual formation of dialects and
languages [13,14]. An analogous situation arises in biology. Genomes are undergoing constant
changes and these changes are more likely to be inherited within a population than between
populations. We refer to this divergence due to accumulation of changes as drift (see Glossary
for a distinction between the biological and traditional linguistic senses of the word).","language change, random drift, adaptation"
Lupyan2016,"Adaptation: in biological evolution,
adaptations are changes to an
organism that lead to an increase in
the frequency of a trait, generally
through an increase in the
reproductive success of the
organism. In cultural evolution,
adaptations are changes that
improve the transmissibility (and,
hence, frequency) of a cultural trait. In
the domain of language, such
improvements can be achieved by
increased fidelity of transmission,
greater learnability, more efficient
comprehension, and so on.","definition, adaptation, biology, linguistics, cultural evolution"

language specific or motivated by more general cognitive tendencies. An example from modern
Mandarin leads to a broader consideration of this phenomenon within Old Chinese (OC), with
particular reference to the reduplicative vocabulary, or dieyin ci 疊音詞 , of the Book of Odes

Viti2014,"This paper discusses the problem of linguistic reconstruction in the Indo-European languages with particular attention to syntax. While many scholars consider syntactic reconstruction as being in principle impossible, other scholars simply apply to syntax the same tenets of the Comparative Method and of Internal Reconstruction, which were originally used in Indo-European studies for reconstructing phonology and morphology. Accordingly, it is assumed that synchronically anomalous syntactic structures are more ancient than productive syntactic constructions; the former are considered as being residues of an early stage of Proto-Indo-European, where they were also more regular and took part in a consistent syntactic system. Various hypotheses of Proto-Indo-European as a syntactically consistent language, which in the last years have witnessed resurgence, are here discussed and criticized. We argue that syntactic consistency is nowhere attested in the Indo-European languages, which in their earliest records rather document an amazing structural variation. Accordingly, we reconstruct Proto-Indo-European as an inconsistent syntactic system in the domains of word order, agreement, configurationality, and alignment, and we consider inconsistency and structural variation to be an original condition of languages. Moreover, we make some proposals for the appropriate use of typology in linguistic reconstruction, with some examples of what can or cannot be reconstructed in syntax.","syntactic variation, syntactic reconstruction, Indo-European, methodology"

Hill2014,"As is well known, PIE possessed several distinct sigmatic formations with modal or future-like semantics. The paper deals with two sigmatic formations which must be reconstructed for PIE and obviously possessed a similar semantic value. First: a full grade -si̯e/o-formation which is attested in Indo-Iranian, Continental Celtic and Balto-Slavonic; and second, an athematic -s-formation which is attested in Italic and in the Eastern branch of Baltic. The diverging morphology of these formations implies that they originally also differed in their semantics. The problem is that both formations are reflected as simple future tense in all daughterlanguages which preserved them. However, it seems possible to detect the original semantic difference between these formations by using the evidence of the only IE branch which preserved both formations side by side, i.e. Baltic. The paper investigates the morphology of the sigmatic future tense in dialects of Lithuanian and Latvian and shows that for the common prehistory of East Baltic dialects a secondary conflation of originally independent PIE formations—-si̯e/o-formation and -s-formation—in one single paradigm must be assumed. The particular distribution of both formations within the unified paradigm of Proto-East-Baltic makes it possible to obtain information on the lost semantic difference between them. Possible traces of the -si̯e/o-formation in the only recorded West Baltic language, Old Prussian, seem to confirm the conclusions drawn on the basis of the East Baltic evidence.","suppletion, semantic reconstruction, Indo-European,"

Mathur2016,"Phylogenies are the commonly used tools for the prediction of ancestry of present day organisms from the past decades. Several methods have been developed to construct phylogenetic trees that predict the history of species by direct linkage of edges. Very few studies have been developed for the phylogenetic networks (which is the generalization of trees). Presently, the methods used to determine phylogenetic networks are based on distance measures or character measures of the sequences of species. It is a very challenging task for computational biologists to find the exact method that can predict the accurate networks of organisms. In this study, a phylogenetic network construction model based on basic graph theory concepts is reported. This model finds the distance matrix of every sequence considered in the study. The two features (positioning and stack interactions) of every DNA sequence and their combined effect have been taken into account to calculate the distances. Results suggested that reticulate events can be observed by using the distances obtained by the proposed method and no such event is predicted by using the distances calculated by the previous method. The important results obtained in the form of distances are 1.637300, 2.000000, 0.932700, 2.331300, 2.829200 and the significance of these values is to represent the different reticulation events among the sequences for different features. Hence distances calculated by this model gives better insights to study the phylogenetic networks.

PatEl2013,"In this paper I have suggested that there are well-tested historical linguistic
tools to help us distinguish between internally and externally motivated
changes: i) Intermediate stages, where the various stages of a process are attested

source language is likely the one where the various stages of the process are
attested. ii) Consistency across categories, where a change is observed in vari-

that a language where a pattern is used broadly and its development is moti-

According to the Chomsky Hierarchy, nested dependencies (context-free) are less complex than cross-serial dependencies (mildly context-sensitive). In two artificial grammar learning (AGL) experiments participants were presented with a language containing either nested or cross-serial dependencies. A learning effect for both types of dependencies could be observed, but no difference between dependency types emerged. These behavioral findings do not seem to reflect complexity differences as described in the Chomsky Hierarchy. This study extends previous findings in demonstrating learning effects for nested and cross-serial dependencies with more natural stimulus materials in a classical AGL paradigm after only one hour of exposure.

Jatteau2016,"Dissimilation is classically considered as a phonetically categorical sound change. In contrast to this assumption, this paper presents evidence for a phonetically gradient pattern of aspiration dissimilation found in Aberystwyth English (Wales): an aspiration feature is consistently reduced in the vicinity of another aspiration feature. Two other patterns of gradient aspiration dissimilation have been reported, in Halh Mongolian and in Georgian, which suggests that it may actually be a more general phenomenon. The Aberystwyth data are however better controlled for phonological contexts and lexical regularity than the Mongolian and the Georgian data. The results can then be discussed in light of the two available theories of dissimilation, Ohala’s (1981) hypercorrection theory, and the traditional link with speech errors. Importantly, a number of arguments support Garrett’s (2015) hypothesis that gradient dissimilation might be a(nother) precursor to complete dissimilation. The pattern thus shows how the use of careful phonetic inspection can lead to a reanalysis of our understanding of well-established diachronic processes.

Background

Archaeobotanical remains of millet were found at the Nan-kuan-li East site in Tainan Science Park, southern Taiwan. This site, dated around 5000–4300 BP, is characterized by remains of the Tapenkeng culture, the earliest Neolithic culture found so far in Taiwan. A large number of millet-like carbonized and charred seeds with varied sizes and shapes were unearthed from the site by the flotation method. Since no millet grain was ever found archaeologically in Taiwan previously, this discovery is of great importance and significance. This paper is in an attempt to further analyze these plant remains for a clearer understanding of the agricultural practice of the ancient inhabitants of the Nan-kuan-li East site.

Result

We used light and scanning electron microscopy to examine the morphological features of some modern domesticated and unearthed seeds to compare and identify the archaeobotanical remains by three criteria: caryopsis shape, embryo notch, and morphology of lemma and palea. We also developed a new methodology for distinguishing the excavated foxtail and broomcorn millet seeds.

Conclusion

Two domesticated millet, including broomcorn millet (Panicum miliaceum) and foxtail millet (Setaria italica), as well as one wild millet species, yellow foxtail (Setaria glauca), were identified in the unearthed seeds. Together with the millet remains, rice was also cultivated in the area. Archaeological evidence shows that millet and rice farming may have been important food sources for people living about 5000 years ago in southern Taiwan.

Jurafsky1996,"The problems of access—retrieving linguistic structure from some mental grammar —and disambiguation—choosing among these structures to correctly parse ambiguous linguistic input—are fundamental to language understanding. The literature abounds with psychological results on lexical access, the access of idioms, syntactic rule access, parsing preferences, syntactic disambiguation, and the processing of garden-path sentences. Unfortunately, it has been difficult to combine models which account for these results to build a general, uniform model of access and disambiguation at the lexical, idiomatic, and syntactic levels. For example, psycholinguistic theories of lexical access and idiom access and parsing theories of syntactic rule access have almost no commonality in methodology or coverage of psycholinguistic data. This article presents a single probabilistic algorithm which models both the access and disambiguation of linguistic knowledge. The algorithm is based on a parallel parser which ranks constructions for access, and interpretations for disambiguation, by their conditional probability. Low-ranked constructions and interpretations are pruned through beam-search; this pruning accounts, among other things, for the garden-path effect. I show that this motivated probabilistic treatment accounts for a wide variety of psycholinguistic results, arguing for a more uniform representation of linguistic knowledge and for the use of probabilistically-enriched grammars and interpreters as models of human knowledge of and processing of language.","access, disambiguation, algorithms, parsing, probabilistic model, language and communication"

These dates are consistent with the genetic history of Tibetans and suggest that a permanent preagricultural peopling of the plateau was enabled by the wetter regional climate at that time.

Current models of the peopling of the higher-elevation zones of the Tibetan Plateau postulate that permanent occupation could only have been facilitated by an agricultural lifeway at ~3.6 thousand calibrated carbon-14 years before present. Here we report a reanalysis of the chronology of the Chusang site, located on the central Tibetan Plateau at an elevation of ~4270 meters above sea level. The minimum age of the site is fixed at ~7.4 thousand years (thorium-230/uranium dating), with a maximum age between ~8.20 and 12.67 thousand calibrated carbon-14 years before present (carbon-14 assays). Travel cost modeling and archaeological data suggest that the site was part of an annual, permanent, preagricultural occupation of the central plateau. These findings challenge current models of the occupation of the Tibetan Plateau.","peopling of the Tibetan Plateau, peopling of South-East Asia, population, population genetics, Sino-Tibetan"

Ao1993,"One problem with the distributionalist approach to phonemic analysis involves the non-uniqueness condition first noted by Chao (@<Chao>1934). For example, since the Mandarin alveopalatals are in complementary distribution with the velars, one might assume that they are allphones of the velars, so that surface [tc\i], [tc\y], etc. are underlyingli /ki/, /ky/ etc. However, since the alveopalatals are also in complementary distribution with the alveolar sibilants, one might also assume that they are allophones of the alveolar sibilants, so that surface [tc\i], [tc\y] etc. are underlyingly /tsi/, /tsy/ etc. Since the putative derivation of the alveopalatals is motivated by their distribution but not supported by any morphophonemic alternation, it is not possible to determine which analysis is correct. As a result, there can be no unique underlying representation of morphemes containing alveopalatals. Such a condition is undesirable, because it implies that phonological representations could be arbitrarily determined, and thereby undermines the validity of phonemic analysis. We can avoid this condition by assuming that the alveopalatals are underlying, not derived. Obviously, doing so would require a departure from the distributionalist tradition.

least explored fields within linguistics. I suggest that these topics would profit
from being explored by linguists and that information on them should be rou-

This article attempts to outline a typology of poetic rhyme. “Rhyme” is defined as
the phonetic identity of sections within text strings (“lines”). Languages vary in
whether the identity is conventionally located in the beginning, the middle or the
end of lines. The latter choice ( end rhyme) is now the by far most common type,
but its present near-global distribution seems to be the result of recent language
contact.
Major typological parameters of end rhyme include the size of the sections at
the line ends that are required to be identical, as well as the partition of the sound
space implied in the notion of “identity”, here called “ rhyme phonology”, which
can differ from the partition of the sound space by ordinary phonology.
Finally, end rhyme in Egyptian is discussed, where this technique became current
only by the Late Coptic period. Being a tradition relatively independent from the
better known European rhymes, Coptic rhyme provides some exotic features
which are of considerable typological interest.","rhyme patterns, Egyptian, cross-linguistic study, end rhyme,"

situations in a speaker's mind as determined by perceived relations of similarity between these
conceptual situations. This paper provides a number of arguments that challenge this view,
based on various types of evidence from processes of semantic change and synchronic
implicational universals. The multifunctionality patterns described by semantic maps may
originate from processes of form-function recombination in particular contexts rather than any
perceived similarity between individual conceptual components. These patterns may also
originate from the fact that a particular functional principle leads to the association of a
particular construction type with different conceptual situations, independently of any specific
relation between these conceptual situations as such. A number of synchronic and diachronic
phenomena pertaining to the very structure of individual semantic maps further reveal that, even
if one assumes that these provide a representation of similarity relations between different
conceptual situations, they do so only to a limited extent.","semantic map, colexification, methodology, mental representation"

Jaeger2005,"I define a slip of the tongue as a one-time error in speech production
planning; that is, the speaker intends to utter a particular word, phrase, or
sentence, and during the planning process something goes wrong, so that the
production is at odds with the plan. It is not simply a misarticulation (e.g.
stuttering or mumbling), a lack of knowledge or memory slip (where the speaker
doesn't know the correct word or can't remember it at the moment), or a false
start (where the speaker changes his or her mind about the propositional content
of the utterance). Speakers themselves will consider the utterance to contain an
error, and will often correct it immediately, sometimes with commentary on the
silliness of what they have said. Extending this definition to child language, the
crucial premise of the current study is that a slip of the tongue cannot be
made on a structure unless that structure has already been learned or
acquired. This is because an utterance cannot be considered to be an error
from the child's point of view, unless the child has a standard within his or her
own system by which to judge the utterance. Note that this definition of 'error'
is different from one commonly used in child language studies, in which the
standard by which the child's utterance is judged is the adult model (e.g. Locke
1980). Of course children produce many utterances which are different from the
adult model because they haven't yet mastered the adult forms. However, if slips
of the tongue made by children are to be considered the same phenomenon as
adult slips, then only the child's current knowledge is relevant as a standard by
which to judge the utterance.","slips of the tongue, child language, introduction"

phylogenetic inference is that horizontal (spatial) transmission obscures vertical (phylogenetic)

vertical and horizontal transmission. To do this, we first construct (1) a spatial neighbor graph
of languages and (2) a phylogenetic neighbor graph by collapsing known language families. We
then develop an autologistic model that predicts a feature’s distribution from these two graphs.

Francois2016a,"The Comparative method is commonly hailed as a solid methodology for comparing genetically related languages, and for reconstructing the history of their linguistic systems. Equally common is the assumption that the results of its analyses are best displayed in the form of a tree, or *Stammbaum:* starting from a common protolanguage, its linguistic descendants should form neatly separated branches and subgroups, eachof which should be defined by a set of exclusively shared innovations. Teh expectation -- or at least the hope -- is that the historical innovations reflected in modern members of a family should be distributed in nested patterns,so as to fit a cladistic representation of that family. This belief is reflected in the vast popularity of the tree model in works of historical linguistics up to this day. 

The present paper aims at separating these two lines of thought, by showing that the strength of the Comparative Method does not necessarily entail the validity of the tree model which has been so often associated with it since the Neogrammarians. In fact, I will even propose that the CM provides precisely the analytical tools necessary to demonstrate the limitations of the tree model. Indeed the method rests on principles of consistency and regularity of sound change, which allow the linguist to conduct rigorous demonstrations in the identification of innovations for each language, and in the reconstruction of words' histories. As each innovation is assigned a set of modern languages, it becomes possible to assess how nested (and thus how tree-like) their distribution is in the family.","family tree, historical glottometry, tree-likeness, conflicting data, wave theory"
Oestling2015,"In this thesis I explore Bayesian models for word alignment, how they can be improved through joint annotation transfer,
and how they can be extended to parallel texts in more than two languages. In addition to these general methodological
developments, I apply the algorithms to problems from sign language research and linguistic typology.
In the first part of the thesis, I show how Bayesian alignment models estimated with Gibbs sampling are more accurate
than previous methods for a range of different languages, particularly for languages with few digital resources available
—which is unfortunately the state of the vast majority of languages today. Furthermore, I explore how different variations
to the models and learning algorithms affect alignment accuracy.
Then, I show how part-of-speech annotation transfer can be performed jointly with word alignment to improve word
alignment accuracy. I apply these models to help annotate the Swedish Sign Language Corpus (SSLC) with part-of-speech
tags, and to investigate patterns of polysemy across the languages of the world.
Finally, I present a model for multilingual word alignment which learns an intermediate representation of the text. This

languages are head-final: in noun phrases, modifiers appear before head
nouns. In contrast, Persian is head-initial: modifiers follow head nouns.
Notably, Azeri allows both head-final and head-initial structures. A
field study conducted with ten Azeri speakers in Tabriz, Iran, revealed
that in noun compounds the two types of structures are used almost
equally. However, older and monolingual speakers prefer the head-final
structure, while younger, educated bilingual speakers prefer the head-
initial structure. This shows that Azeri is becoming persified in this
domain, as predicted in such situations of language contact involving a
politically-dominant language. However, all speakers accept head-final

Hintze2010,"Background: Much work in systems biology, but also in the analysis of social network and communication and
transport infrastructure, involves an in-depth analysis of local and global properties of those networks, and how these
properties relate to the function of the network within the integrated system. Most often, systematic controls for such
networks are difficult to obtain, because the features of the network under study are thought to be germane to that
function. In most such cases, a surrogate network that carries any or all of the features under consideration, while
created artificially and in the absence of any selective pressure relating to the function of the network being studied,
would be of considerable interest.

Results: Here, we present an algorithmic model for growing networks with a broad range of biologically and
technologically relevant degree distributions using only a small set of parameters. Specifying network connectivity via
an assortativity matrix allows us to grow networks with arbitrary degree distributions and arbitrary modularity. We
show that the degree distribution is controlled mainly by the ratio of node to edge addition probabilities, and the
probability for node duplication. We compare topological and functional modularity measures, study their
dependence on the number and strength of modules, and introduce the concept of anti-modularity: a property of
networks in which nodes from one functional group preferentially do not attach to other nodes of that group. We also
investigate global properties of networks as a function of the network's growth parameters, such as smallest path
length, correlation coefficient, small-world-ness, and the nature of the percolation phase transition. We search the
space of networks for those that are most like some well-known biological examples, and analyze the biological
significance of the parameters that gave rise to them.

Conclusions: Growing networks with specified characters (degree distribution and modularity) provides the
opportunity to create surrogates for biological and technological networks, and to test hypotheses about the
processes that gave rise to them. We find that many celebrated network properties may be a consequence of the way
in which these networks grew, rather than a necessary consequence of how they work or function.","growing network, graph theory, modularity, assortativity, "

@Lewis2016a,"Measuring the phylogenetic information content of data has a long history in systematics. Here we explore a Bayesian approach to information content estimation. The entropy of the posterior distribution compared with the entropy of the prior distribution provides a natural way to measure information content. If the data have no information relevant to ranking tree topologies beyond the information supplied by the prior, the posterior and prior will be identical. Information in data discourages consideration of some hypotheses allowed by the prior, resulting in a posterior distribution that is more concentrated (has lower entropy) than the prior. We focus on measuring information about tree topology using marginal posterior distributions of tree topologies. We show that both the accuracy and the computational efficiency of topological information content estimation improve with use of the conditional clade distribution, which also allows topological information content to be partitioned by clade. We explore two important applications of our method: providing a compelling definition of saturation and detecting conflict among data partitions that can negatively affect analyses of concatenated data.","Bayesian inference, phylogenetic information content, "

properties of effective communication: (a) the contribution of the phonological unit in context to accurate
message transmission, and (b) the resource cost of the phonological unit (see Hall, Hume, Jaeger & Wedel,
forthcoming). In order to demonstrate this, we begin in §2 by describing key properties of language as a
system of information transmission. In the following section, we turn to the predictions that follow from
such a system for perceptually weak and strong sound patterns and show why it makes sense for them both
to be described as unmarked.","markedness, predictability, systemic processes, context"

messages, defined with reference to a language's morphemes, words or higher
levels of meaning, rather than influencing phonological categories directly.
Integrating concepts from information theory and Bayesian inference with the
existing body of phonological research, we propose a testable model of

processes was investigated in French verbs. Our aim was to define the verbal stem formation
structure processed during mental lexicon access in French. We conducted a cross-modal experiment

Si2016,"Traditional ecological knowledge recorded as part of a language documentation program
can include valuable information on the presence or absence of plant and animal species in a given
locality. Such data have the potential to inform biodiversity surveys at a local or landscape scale.
In this study, bird names were recorded in six languages spoken around the town of Aungban in
Shan State, Myanmar. A checklist of local birds was first compiled using online sources, and pictures
and recordings of the calls of over 250 species were presented to native speakers to elicit bird names.
A statistically significant correlation was found between the number of languages in which a bird
was named, and the frequency with which it was sighted by ornithologists in a recently published
study at a nearby location. Native speakers provided historical information on birds that were once
present near their villages, and it was also possible to obtain indications of small-scale differences
in the ranges of some birds. While there were some noteworthy mismatches between the number
of sightings of some birds and the number of names recorded in the target languages, the findings
indicate that overall, a language-documentation-based survey of bird species occurrence can provide
valuable biodiversity information in a quick and cost-effective manner.","flora and fauna, concept list, denotation"
Starostin2016c,"The paper presents a brief assessment of “Nostratic” – the controversial, but promising
hypothesis on deeper linguistic connections of the Indo-European family, as envisaged by Vladislav
Illich-Svitych and his contemporaries (particularly Aharon Dolgopolsky). We discuss some of the
most important developments of the theory since the 1960s, and explain how emphasis on “quan-
tity over quality” of data in the new huge corpora of “Nostratic” comparanda is less useful for
advancing the hypothesis than a narrowly targeted emphasis on identifying the “core” evidence for
the macrofamily. Identifying this “core” evidence, consisting of a small, but generally stable layer
of the basic lexicon, is necessary to lend a more historically realistic flavor to the hypothesis, and its
statistical evaluation will also help better understand the place of Indo-European among the other
potential constituents of “Nostratic”. We argue that, in weighing the evidence, typological plausi-
bility of semantic shifts and absence of topological conflicts in the tree are no less important than
regularity of sound changes. We also show how the credibility level of various theories on the exter-
nal connections of Indo-European can be arranged along a gradient – from “Indo-Uralic” to a gen-
eral “Nostratic”, and indicate implications that such an arrangement may hold for future studies.","Nostratic, Indo-European, long-range comparison, historical overview,"

Hill2015b,"Tangut is among a handful of Trans-Himalayan 1 languages with an early date of
attestation and a vast literature. First recorded in 1042 C.E., Tangut is more recent
than Chinese (c. 1200 B.C.E) and Tibetan (650 C.E.), but older than Burmese
(1113 C.E.). With the loss of the Tangut polity to the Mongols in 1227 C.E., the
language gradually declined, with the most recent known text from 1499 C.E. The
decipherment of Tangut became possible after Pyotr Kozlov excavated a sizable
number of documents at Khara-Khoto in 1909 and transferred them to St Petersburg.
The language and its literature are now reasonably well understood and actively
researched. Nonetheless, the diachronic development of the language has garnered
scant attention. The work under review treats the phonology and morphology of
Tangut within a comparative context. Jacques makes particular reference to Japhug
Rgyalrong, a spoken language of our day. By any standard, the methodological
rigor and philological sophistication of this work is outstanding. The author has
mastery over Tangut philology and its attendant secondary literature, written in
French; the work consults research in Russian, Chinese, and Japanese. Tangut texts
are cited at first hand and lucidly presented. In addition, Jacques brings the results
of his extensive fieldwork on Japhug Rgyalrong to bear throughout.","review, Tangut, Sino-Tibetan, "

Blevins2013,"Over the past decade, information theory has been applied to the analysis of a
successively broader range of morphological phenomena. Interestingly, this tradition has
arisen independently of the linguistic applications of information theory dating from the
1950’s. Instead, the point of origin for current work lies in a series of studies of morphological
processing in which Kostić and associates develop a statistical notion of ‘morphological
information’ based on ‘uncertainty’ and ‘uncertainty reduction’. From these initial studies,
analyses based on statistical notions of information have been applied to general problems of
morphological description and typological classification, leading to a formal rehabilitation of
the complex system perspective of traditional WP models.","paradigms, word formation, word derivation, morphology, inflection, "

Hoehna2016,"Programs for Bayesian inference of phylogeny currently implement a unique and fixed suite of models.
Consequently, users of these software packages are simultaneously forced to use a number of programs for a given study,
while also lacking the freedom to explore models that have not been implemented by the developers of those programs.
We developed a new open-source software package, RevBayes, to address these problems. RevBayes is entirely based on
probabilistic graphical models, a powerful generic framework for specifying and analyzing statistical models. Phylogenetic-
graphical models can be specified interactively in RevBayes, piece by piece, using a new succinct and intuitive language
called Rev. Rev is similar to the R language and the BUGS model-specification language, and should be easy to learn
for most users. The strength of RevBayes is the simplicity with which one can design, specify, and implement new and
complex models. Fortunately, this tremendous flexibility does not come at the cost of slower computation; as we demonstrate,
RevBayes outperforms competing software for several standard analyses. Compared with other programs, RevBayes has
fewer black-box elements. Users need to explicitly specify each part of the model and analysis. Although this explicitness
may initially be unfamiliar, we are convinced that this transparency will improve understanding of phylogenetic models
in our field. Moreover, it will motivate the search for improvements to existing methods by brazenly exposing the model
choices that we make to critical scrutiny. RevBayes is freely available at http://www.RevBayes.com.","Bayesian approaches, Bayesian inference, phylogenetic reconstruction, software"
Schackow2015,"This work is the first comprehensive description of the Yakkha language (iso-639:
ybh), a Kiranti language spoken in Eastern Nepal. The primary focus of this work
is on the dialect spoken in Tumok village.
The grammar is intended to serve as a reference to scholars interested in lin-
guistic typology and comparative studies of Tibeto-Burman and Himalayan lan-
guages in general, and also as a foundation for members of the Yakkha commu-
nity to aid future research and activities aiming at documenting and preserving
their language.
The grammar is written in a typological framework. Wherever possible I have
tried to incorporate a historical perspective and comparative data in explaining
how a particular subsystem of the grammar works. For the sake of reader friendli-
ness and to ensure long-term comprehensibility, the analyses are not presented
within any particular theoretical framework, and terms that strongly imply a
particular theory have been avoided as far as this was possible.
Preparing a grammar can be a simultaneously satisfying and frustrating task,
both for the same reason: the sheer abundance of topics one has to deal with,
which makes grammars very different from works that pursue more specific
questions. Necessarily, a focus had to be set for this work, which eventually
fell on morphosyntactic issues. Verbal inflection, transitivity, grammatical rela-
tions, nominalization, complex predication and clause linkage are dealt with in
greater detail, while other topics such as phonology, the tense/aspect system and
information structure leave much potential for further research. Since this is the
first grammatical description of Yakkha, I have decided to include also the topics
that are analyzed in less detail, in order to share as much as possible about this

**Background**

The wealth of prokaryotic genomic data available has revealed that the histories of many genes are inconsistent, leading some to question the value of the tree of life hypothesis. It has been argued that a tree-like representation requires suppressing too much information, and that a more pluralistic approach is necessary for understanding prokaryotic evolution. We argue that trees may still be a useful representation for evolutionary histories in light of new data.

**Results**

Genomic data alone can be highly misleading when trying to resolve the tree of life. We present evidence from protein abundance data sets that genomic conservation greatly underestimates functional conservation. Function follows more of a tree-like structure than genetic material, even in the presence of horizontal transfer. We argue that the tree of cells must be incorporated into any new synthesis in order to place horizontal transfers into their proper selective context. We also discuss the role data sources other than primary sequence can play in resolving the tree of cells.

**Conclusions**

The tree of life is alive, but not well. Construction of the tree of cells has been viewed as the end goal of the study of evolution, where in reality we need to consider it more of a starting point. We propose a duality where we must consider variation of genetic material in terms of networks and selection of cellular function in terms of trees. Otherwise one gets lost in the woods of neutral evolution.

Malkiel1954,"It may seem strange against the background of this avid search for new techniques of grouping that no systematic inquiry has, to my knowledge at least, yet been made into ways and means of extracting etymologically useful information from the configuration of word families. Modern linguistics stresses the fundamental kinship of inflection and syntax which traditional teachings used to separate quite sharply. Also it has become empirically know that word formation (that is, derivation and composition) which, with inflection propoer, makes up morphology in the Indo-European languages, is best studied and practiced jointly with etymology. [...] In monographs and dictionaries alike [...] the consistent grouping of words by families has almost become standard practice. ","etymology, word family, word history"

List2017c,"The amount of data from languages spoken all over the world is rapidly increasing. Traditional manual methods in historical linguistics need to face the challenges brought by this influx of data. Automatic approaches to word comparison could provide invaluable help to pre-analyze data which can be later enhanced by experts. In this way, computational approaches can take care of the repetitive and schematic tasks leaving experts to concentrate on answering interesting questions. Here we test the potential of automatic methods to detect etymologically related words (cognates) in cross-linguistic data. Using a newly compiled database of expert cognate judgments across five different language families, we compare how well different automatic approaches distinguish related from unrelated words. Our results show that automatic methods can identify cognates with a very high degree of accuracy, reaching 89% for the best-performing method Infomap. We identify the specific strengths and weaknesses of these different methods and point to major challenges for future approaches.

is to allow speakers to refer to spatially delimited body segments. Current
evidence suggests that, crosslinguistically, the most common principle of
body segmentation is visual discontinuity (Enfield et al. 2006). For instance,

I argue that although ‘proportional’ analogical innovation plays a major role in
paradigm leveling, it cannot account for all cases, and that something akin to the
‘interference’ mechanisms commonly associated with contamination and folk
etymology account well for the non-proportional instances. I further show that
all of the mechanisms involved in paradigm leveling are also implicated in other
types of analogical change, and I argue against the need to posit any universal bias
against (stem) allomorphy.","paradigm levelling, tendencies, morphological change"
Fertig2016,"Paradigm leveling is a common kind of morphophonological development in
many languages. A well-known example, shown in (1), involves the alternation
between diphthongal and monophthongal root vowels that arose in a number of
verbs in Old French – depending on whether stress fell on the root or on the fol-
lowing syllable in a given form – and was subsequently eliminated (‘leveled’) in
favor of the reflexes of the Old French diphthongs","French, paradigm levelling, examples, definition"
Fertig2016,"One fundamental issue concerns the relevant definition of ‘paradigm’. There
are two basic dimensions to morphological structure. On one axis, we can group [pb]
ogether the inflected forms of a given word (e.g., break, breaks, breaking, broke,
broken) and lexemes based on the same root (break, breakable, unbroken, etc.); on
the other axis, we can group forms of different words that correspond in one or
more grammatical categories (e.g., broke, ate, walked, etc. or breakable, wearable,
readable, etc.). Many linguists identify paradigms exclusively with the first of these
dimensions (e.g., Harris 1973: 67; McCarthy 2005: 172; cf. Kenstowicz 2005 for
discussion), and quite a few further restrict their notion of paradigm to inflectionally related forms (e.g., McCarthy 2005: 174; Albright 2011: 1972). That the
tendency to level alternations is generally stronger within inflectional paradigms
than among derivationally related words has long been widely recognized (Paul
1886: 169; Kiparsky 1972: 208).","inflection classes, systemic processes, paradigm levelling, morphological change"

discussion on p. 493). If we can recover the lexical value of a given morpheme, it
means among other things that in historical terms such a morpheme may belong
to a recent layer of the grammar. This idea is supported by the nature of the sound
correspondences which can be deduced from the table on pp. 485–486: they are
all trivial one-to-one correspondences (the only sound changes involved include
palatalization before /i/ or spirantization of velar segments). The fact that these
morphemes are extremely unlikely to be very archaic considerably decreases their
probative value. Furthermore, all of these grammaticalizations are very common

Orlovaite2015,"This paper introduces a new automatic cognate identification approach that can take as
input orthographic word lists and produce both pairwise and group-based decisions.
While the initial goal of the project was to reproduce the (@Hauer<2011> & Kondrak, 2011)
cognate discovery method, several weaknesses of the model were discovered. The approach introduced here addresses these issues and follows the comparative method
more closely. First, instead of choosing string similarity measures that appear to be
reasonable, feature selection is employed, leading to eight best-performing attributes.
Second, different aspects of cognateness are captured by also incorporating part-of-
speech, letter correspondence, and language family information into the model. Third,
strings are selectively preprocessed using either vowel removal or sound class substitu-
tion in order to reduce the gap between letters and phonemes, and to only penalize
word differences if they are unlikely to appear in cognates. Finally, logistic regression
is employed instead of SVM, using probabilities of cognateness as distance measures
in hierarchical agglomerative clustering. The reproduced (Hauer & Kondrak, 2011)
approach, the new method, and three rule-based baselines are tested using the 95-

never tired to acknowledge his debt to Saussure ; by contrast, his influence on his former teacher with

nature of language and linguistic methodology. But these are usually expressed in book reviews and
few papers ; all studies of his of book length are devoted to languages or language groups of the Indo-

general linguistic ideas reveals that he usually stated the obvious at least if compared with what
Saussure had to say about the foundations of linguistics, and that there is little that Saussure could
have found in Meillet as a generalise It is therefore not surprising that Meillet's reaction to the Cours de

Yaveroglu2015,"**Motivation:** Network comparison is a computationally intractable problem with important applica-
tions in systems biology and other domains. A key challenge is to properly quantify similarity
between wiring patterns of two networks in an alignment-free fashion. Also, alignment-based
methods exist that aim to identify an actual node mapping between networks and as such serve a
different purpose. Various alignment-free methods that use different global network properties
(e.g. degree distribution) have been proposed. Methods based on small local subgraphs called
graphlets perform the best in the alignment-free network comparison task, due to high level of
topological detail that graphlets can capture. Among different graphlet-based methods, Graphlet
Correlation Distance (GCD) was shown to be the most accurate for comparing networks. Recently,
a new graphlet-based method called NetDis was proposed, which was claimed to be superior.
We argue against this, as the performance of NetDis was not properly evaluated to position it
correctly among the other alignment-free methods.

**Results:** We evaluate the performance of available alignment-free network comparison methods,
including GCD and NetDis. We do this by measuring accuracy of each method (in a systematic
precision-recall framework) in terms of how well the method can group (cluster) topologically simi-
lar networks. By testing this on both synthetic and real-world networks from different domains, we
show that GCD remains the most accurate, noise-tolerant and computationally efficient alignment-
free method. That is, we show that NetDis does not outperform the other methods, as originally
claimed, while it is also computationally more expensive. Furthermore, since NetDis is dependent
on the choice of a network null model (unlike the other graphlet-based methods), we show that its
performance is highly sensitive to the choice of this parameter. Finally, we find that its performance
is not independent on network sizes and densities, as originally claimed","alignment, networks, network comparison, introduction"

Cooney2017,"The origin and expansion of biological diversity is regulated by
both developmental trajectories 1,2 and limits on available ecological
niches 3–7 . As lineages diversify, an early and often rapid phase of
species and trait proliferation gives way to evolutionary slow-
downs as new species pack into ever more densely occupied regions
of ecological niche space 6,8 . Small clades such as Darwin’s finches
demonstrate that natural selection is the driving force of adaptive
radiations, but how microevolutionary processes scale up to shape
the expansion of phenotypic diversity over much longer evolutionary
timescales is unclear 9 . Here we address this problem on a global scale
by analysing a crowdsourced dataset of three-dimensional scanned
bill morphology from more than 2,000 species. We find that bill
diversity expanded early in extant avian evolutionary history, before
transitioning to a phase dominated by packing of morphological
space. However, this early phenotypic diversification is decoupled
from temporal variation in evolutionary rate: rates of bill evolution
vary among lineages but are comparatively stable through time. We
find that rare, but major, discontinuities in phenotype emerge from
rapid increases in rate along single branches, sometimes leading
to depauperate clades with unusual bill morphologies. Despite
these jumps between groups, the major axes of within-group
bill-shape evolution are remarkably consistent across birds. We
reveal that macroevolutionary processes underlying global-scale

Haspelmath2016,"Since the 1970s, serial verb constructions (SVCs) have been discussed widely in African, Oceanic and
many other languages throughout the world. This article gives an overview of the most important generalizations
about SVCs that have been proposed and that do seem to hold if a sufficiently restrictive definition of the concept
is adopted. The main problem with the earlier comparative literature is that the notion of an SVC has not been
delimited clearly, and/or has been formulated in much too wide terms. As a result, some linguists have despaired
of finding a coherent cross-linguistic concept of SVC. For example, one scholar asked ‘Are there any universal
defining properties of serial verb constructions? Probably not . . .’. These problems can be seen as a result of the
confusion between comparative concepts and natural kinds: Serial verb constructions have (most often implic-
itly) been regarded as natural kinds (universal categories), so that phenomena in additional languages were
regarded as SVCs even when they had somewhat different properties. This procedure inevitably leads to a fuzzy
and very broad understanding of the concept, with a prototype (or ‘canonical’) structure that does not allow
falsifiable claims. Here I propose a narrow definition of SVC and formulate 10 universals that are apparently
true of all serial verb constructions in this narrow sense. The claim that these are universally true of (narrowly
defined) serial verb constructions is based on a thorough reading of the comparative and theoretical literature,
not on a systematic sample of language—the latter would not have been practical, because SVCs are rarely
described in sufficient detail in descriptive grammars. No attempt is made at explaining these generalizations
in the present article, but I claim that we finally have a good idea of what it is that needs to be explained in a
general way.","serial verb constructions, introduction, cross-linguistic study"

Harding1988,"Genetic distances among speakers of the
European language families were computed by using gene-
frequency data for human blood group antigens, enzymes, and
proteins of 26 genetic systems. Each system was represented by
a different subset of 3369 localities across Europe. By subject-
ing the matrix of distances to numerical taxonomic procedures,
we obtained a grouping of the language families of Europe by
their genetic distances as contrasted with their linguistic
relationships. The resulting classification largely reflects geo-
graphic propinquity rather than linguistic origins. This is
evidence for the primary importance of short-range interdemic
gene flow in shaping the modern gene pools of Europe. Yet,
some language families-i.e., Basque, Finnic (including Lap-
pish), and Semitic (Maltese)-have distant genetic relation-
ships with their geographic neighbors. These results indicate
that European gene pools still reflect the remote origins of some
ethnic units subsumed by these major linguistic groups.","genetic classification, genetic distance, European languages, "
Goddard2010a,"In the NSM approach to semantic analysis, semantic molecules are a well-de-
fined set of non-primitive lexical meanings in a given language that function as
intermediate-level units in the structure of complex meanings in that language.
After reviewing existing work on the molecules concept (including the notion of
levels of nesting), the paper advances a provisional list of about 180 productive
semantic molecules for English, suggesting that a small minority of these (about
25) may be universal. It then turns close attention to a set of potentially universal
level-one molecules from the “environmental” domain (‘sky’, ‘ground’, ‘sun’, ‘day’,
‘night’ ‘water’ and ‘fire’), proposing a set of original semantic explications for
them. Finally, the paper considers the theoretical implications of the molecule
theory for our understanding of semantic complexity, cross-linguistic variation
in the structure of the lexicon, and the translatability of semantic explications.","semantic molecules, natural semantic metalanguage, "
Goddard2006,"This paper explains and explores the concept of “semantic molecules” in the NSM
methodology of semantic analysis. A semantic molecule is a complex lexical
meaning which functions as an intermediate unit in the structure of other, more
complex concepts. The paper undertakes an overview of different kinds of semantic
molecule, showing how they enter into more complex meanings and how they
themselves can be explicated. It shows that four levels of “nesting” of molecules
within molecules are attested, and it argues that while some molecules, such as
‘hands’ and ‘make’, may well be language-universal, many others are language-
specific.","semantic molecules, natural semantic metalanguage"
Montemurro2011,"Background: The language faculty is probably the most distinctive feature of our species, and endows us with a unique
ability to exchange highly structured information. In written language, information is encoded by the concatenation of basic
symbols under grammatical and semantic constraints. As is also the case in other natural information carriers, the resulting
symbolic sequences show a delicate balance between order and disorder. That balance is determined by the interplay
between the diversity of symbols and by their specific ordering in the sequences. Here we used entropy to quantify the
contribution of different organizational levels to the overall statistical structure of language.

Methodology/Principal Findings: We computed a relative entropy measure to quantify the degree of ordering in word
sequences from languages belonging to several linguistic families. While a direct estimation of the overall entropy of
language yielded values that varied for the different families considered, the relative entropy quantifying word ordering
presented an almost constant value for all those families.

Conclusions/Significance: Our results indicate that despite the differences in the structure and vocabulary of the languages
analyzed, the impact of word ordering in the structure of language is a statistical linguistic universal.","word order, cross-linguistic study, entropy"

Sokal1988,"Genetic and taxonomic distances were com-
puted for 3466 samples of human populations in Europe based
on 97 allele frequencies and 10 cranial variables. Since the
actual samples employed differed among the genetic systems
studied, the genetic distances were computed separately for
each system, as were matrices of geographic distances and of
linguistic distances based on membership in the same language
family or phylum. Significant matrix correlations between
genetics and geography were found for the majority of sys-
tems; somewhat less frequent are significant correlations
between genetics and language. The effects of the two factors
can be separated by means of partial matrix correlations.
These show significant values for both genetics and geography,
language kept constant, and genetics and language, geography
kept constant, with a tendency for the former to be higher.
These findings demonstrate that speakers of different language
families in Europe differ genetically and that this difference
remains even after geographic differentiation is allowed for.
The greater effect of geography than of language may be due
to the several factors that bring about spatial differentiation in
human populations.","genetic distance, European languages, "

to be sufficiently identified by F0 contour, while phonation cues are
redundant. This study provides evidence to show that native Mandarin

relies on phonation cues in its identification than the other three tones,
which probably derives from the usual accompanying non-modal voice

to define language tones in a finer model that incorporates detailed

Smith2004,"Human language is unique among the communication systems of the natural
world. The vocabulary of human language is unique in being both culturally-transmitted
and symbolic. In this paper I present an investigation into the factors involved in
the evolution of such vocabulary systems. I investigate both the cultural evolution
of vocabulary systems and the biological evolution of learning rules for vocabulary
acquisition.
Firstly, vocabularies are shown to evolve on a cultural time-scale so as to fit
the expectations of learners — a population’s vocabulary adapts to the biases of
the learners in that population. A learning bias in favour of one-to-one mappings
between meanings and words leads to the cultural evolution of communicatively-
optimal vocabulary systems, even in the absence of any explicit pressure for commu-
nication. Furthermore, the pressure to conform to the biases of learners is shown to
outweigh natural selection acting on cultural transmission. Human language learn-
ers appear to bring a one-to-one bias to the acquisition of vocabulary systems. The
functionality of human vocabulary may therefore be a consequence of the biases of
human language learners.
Secondly, the evolutionary stability of genetically-transmitted vocabulary learning
biases is investigated using both static and dynamic models. A one-to-one learning
bias, which leads to the cultural evolution of optimal communication, is shown to be
evolutionarily stable. However, the evolution de novo of this bias is complicated by
the cumulative nature of the cultural evolution of vocabulary systems. This suggests
that the biases of human language learners may not have evolved specifically and
exclusively for the acquisition of communicatively-functional vocabulary.","lexical change, vocabulary evolution, simulation studies,"
Smith2012,"The distribution of frequency counts of distinct words by length in a language’s vocabulary will
be analyzed using two methods. The first, will look at the empirical distributions of several languages and
derive a distribution that reasonably explains the number of distinct words as a function of length. We will
be able to derive the frequency count, mean word length, and variance of word length based on the
marginal probability of letters and spaces. The second, based on information theory, will demonstrate that
the conditional entropies can also be used to estimate the frequency of distinct words of a given length in a
language. In addition, it will be shown how these techniques can also be applied to estimate higher order
entropies using vocabulary word length.","word length, word frequency, distribution, quantitative analysis"

Duda2016,"Over the past two decades numerous new trees of modern human populations have been published
extensively but little attention has been paid to formal phylogenetic synthesis. We utilized the “matrix
representation with parsimony” (MRP) method to infer a composite phylogeny (supertree) of modern
human populations, based on 257 genetic/genomic, as well as linguistic, phylogenetic trees and 44
admixture plots from 200 published studies (1990–2014). The resulting supertree topology includes
the most basal position of S African Khoisan followed by C African Pygmies, and the paraphyletic
section of all other sub-Saharan peoples. The sub-Saharan African section is basal to the monophyletic
clade consisting of the N African–W Eurasian assemblage and the consistently monophyletic Eastern
superclade (Sahul–Oceanian, E Asian, and Beringian–American peoples). This topology, dominated
by genetic data, is well-resolved and robust to parameter set changes, with a few unstable areas (e.g.,
West Eurasia, Sahul–Melanesia) reflecting the existing phylogenetic controversies. A few populations
were identified as highly unstable “wildcard taxa” (e.g. Andamanese, Malagasy). The linguistic
classification fits rather poorly on the supertree topology, supporting a view that direct coevolution
between genes and languages is far from universal.","human population, human prehistory, population genetics, population history"

Jin and Jianghuai Mandarin dialects which show that entering tone and stop final changes were caused by vowel
height, this paper argues that the division pattern of the entering tone in the Fanyi Laoqida Piaotongshi has a factual
basis. In the 16th century, the entering tone of Mandarin which Cui Shizhen ( 崔世珍 ) recorded had been divided into
two categories according to vowel height. This pattern is very similar to the modern Lu’an ( 六安 ) and Shucheng

Jianghuai Mandarin share a genealogical relationship, but it may also just be a typological similarity caused by the

We report a comparative study of consensus, maximum parsimony, and maximum likelihood methods of species network reconstruction using gene trees simulated assuming a known species history. We evaluate the role of the divergence time between species involved in a hybridization event, the relative contributions of the hybridizing species, and the error in gene tree estimation. When gene tree discordance is mostly due to hybridization and not due to incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), most of the methods can detect even highly skewed hybridization events between highly divergent species. For recent divergences between hybridizing species, when the influence of ILS is sufficiently high, likelihood methods outperform parsimony and consensus methods, which erroneously identify extra hybridizations. The more sophisticated likelihood methods, however, are affected by gene tree errors to a greater extent than are consensus and parsimony.","simulation studies, incomplete lineage sorting, maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, hybridization"

Progovac2016,"In making an argument for the antiquity of language, based on comparative evidence,
Dediu and Levinson (2013) express hope that some combinations of structural features
will prove so conservative that they will allow deep linguistic reconstruction. I propose
that the earliest stages of syntax/grammar as reconstructed in Progovac (2015a), based
on a theoretical and data-driven linguistic analysis, provide just such a conservative
platform, which would have been commanded also by Neandertals and the common
ancestor. I provide a fragment of this proto-grammar, which includes flat verb-noun
compounds used for naming and insult (e.g., rattle-snake, cry-baby, scatter-brain), and
paratactic (loose) combinations of such flat structures (e.g., Come one, come all; You
seek, you find). This flat, binary, paratactic platform is found in all languages, and can
be shown to serve as foundation for any further structure building. However, given
the degree and nature of variation across languages in elaborating syntax beyond this
proto-stage, I propose that hierarchical syntax did not emerge once and uniformly
in all its complexity, but rather multiple times, either within Africa, or after dispersion
from Africa. If so, then, under the uniregional hypothesis, our common ancestor with
Neandertals, H. heidelbergensis, could not have commanded hierarchical syntax, but
“only” the proto-grammar. Linguistic reconstructions of this kind are necessary for
formulating precise and testable hypotheses regarding language evolution. In addition
to the hominin timeline, this reconstruction can also engage, and negotiate between, the
fields of neuroscience and genetics, as I illustrate with one specific scenario involving
FOXP2 gene.","speculation, language evolution, language origin, Neandertal, "

several redundant cliques were produced that differed from each

[21] between maximal clique pairs were computed. The Ham-

equal length, counting the number of substitutions to change the
first string into the second [21]. We defined the fractional
Hamming distance between a pair of cliques as the regular
Hamming distance divided by the total number of sequences in
both cliques. This normalization eliminated the effects of the
possible discrepancy between the clique sizes on the distance

Background

Recent advances in rapid, low-cost sequencing have opened up the opportunity to study complete genome sequences. The computational approach of multiple genome alignment allows investigation of evolutionarily related genomes in an integrated fashion, providing a basis for downstream analyses such as rearrangement studies and phylogenetic inference.

Graphs have proven to be a powerful tool for coping with the complexity of genome-scale sequence alignments. The potential of graphs to intuitively represent all aspects of genome alignments led to the development of graph-based approaches for genome alignment. These approaches construct a graph from a set of local alignments, and derive a genome alignment through identification and removal of graph substructures that indicate errors in the alignment.

Results

We compare the structures of commonly used graphs in terms of their abilities to represent alignment information. We describe how the graphs can be transformed into each other, and identify and classify graph substructures common to one or more graphs. Based on previous approaches, we compile a list of modifications that remove these substructures.

Conclusion

We show that crucial pieces of alignment information, associated with inversions and duplications, are not visible in the structure of all graphs. If we neglect vertex or edge labels, the graphs differ in their information content. Still, many ideas are shared among all graph-based approaches. Based on these findings, we outline a conceptual framework for graph-based genome alignment that can assist in the development of future genome alignment tools.

Ibbotson2017,"Verbirgt sich im menschlichen Gehirn tatsächlich eine
vorprogrammierte mentale Schablone zum Erlernen
von Grammatik? Mit dieser Idee prägte der amerika-

Vielmehr setzt sich eine radikal neue Sichtweise durch,
der zufolge das Erlernen der Muttersprache kein angebore­

sprachspezifisch sein müssen – etwa die Fähigkeit, die Welt
in Kategorien (wie Mensch oder Sache) einzuteilen oder
Beziehungen zwischen Dingen zu begreifen. Hinzu kommt
die einzigartige Gabe, intuitiv zu erfassen, was uns andere
mitteilen möchten; erst so kann Sprache entstehen. Somit
reicht Chomskys Theorie längst nicht aus, um den
menschlichen Spracherwerb zu erklären.

Diese Schlussfolgerung wirkt sich nicht bloß auf die
Linguistik aus, sondern auf ganz unterschiedliche Be-
reiche, in denen Sprache eine zentrale Rolle spielt, von der
Poesie bis zur künstlichen Intelligenz. Da außerdem Men-

Croft2017,"After a long period in which the study of the evolutionary origins of the human
language capacity was avoided, some linguists now speculate or use compu-
tational modeling to try to infer the evolutionary process that led to modern
human language. It is assumed that the evolution of language represents an
increase in some sort of linguistic complexity: “pre-language” was less com-
plex than modern human language in some ways, and – probably gradually –
acquired the sort of complexity that modern human languages display.

Complexity in language is frequently measured in two ways: structural com-
plexity of communicative signals, and the social-cognitive complexity of the
interactional situations in which language or language-like communication is
used. Some linguists are now attempting to measure structural complexity of
contemporary human languages, after a period in which it was assumed that
all modern languages were equal in overall structural complexity. There are
undoubtedly significant differences among contemporary human languages in
terms of the obligatory expression of certain grammatical semantic categories,
and the formal morphological complexity of that expression. Nevertheless,
all attested human languages display similar degrees of structural complex-
ity in “design features” of language (Hockett 1960). These design features
include the combinability and recombinability of meaningful units; some kind
of hierarchical structure; recursion (but see Everett 2005, 2009), and duality of
patterning.","language evolution, complex systems, writing systems, linguistic complexity"
Duanmu2008,"To many people it may seem obvious what syllables are. For example,
the English word buy is a syllable, so is the Chinese word ni ‘you’. The
English word city has two syllables, so does the Chinese word mayi
‘ant’. The word potato has three syllables; the word syllabification has
six syllables; and so on.

However, the clarity can be deceptive. While in some words it is easy
to count syllables, in others the answer is not so obvious. For example,
is the word hour or shower one or two syllables? In addition, while we
can often count the number of syllables, it is not always clear where
syllable boundaries are. For example, where is the syllable boundary
in city and happy? Are all the sounds in smile in one syllable, or are [s]
and [l] outside the syllable [mai]?

Linguists have wrestled with various answers. In (1) we see several
views of syllable count in hour, flour, flower, and shower, which only
differ in the initial consonant(s).

[...]

If syllables are real, we want to know what their structures are and
to what extent they can differ from language to language. For example,
if [m] can be a syllable in English (as in prism), should we expect
[mdok] ‘color’ in the Tibeto-Burman language Jiarong, mgła [mgwa]
‘fog’ in Polish, and [mba] ‘be’ in the African language Mende, to be
two syllables each as well? More generally, is the analysis of a string of
sounds, such as [mdok], the same for all languages, or can the analysis
vary from language to language?

In this book I explore answers to such questions. Since syllables are
made of sounds and sounds are made of features, I start in Chapter 2
with a discussion of sounds and features, with a focus on the notion
of complex sounds. In Chapter 3 I review theories of syllable structure
and argue for a new proposal, which I call the CVX theory, according
to which the maximal syllable size is CVX (CVV or CVC) and extra
consonants at word edges are explained by morphology.","syllable structure, syllable boundaries, phonology, "

of the verb go in other constructions, such as I’m going to the store now. It isn’t the word

Kheng2017,"This research provides a phonological description of the Mkuui variety of Daai Chin.
Mkuui is one of seven varieties of Daai Chin and is spoken in six villages in Mindat
and Paletwa Townships in the Southern Chin Hills of Chin State, Myanmar. Daai
Chin belongs to the Southern branch of the Kuki-Naga-Chin group, which is under
the Tibeto-Burman language family.

A wordlist of 1693 lexical items was collected from three mother tongue speakers of
Mkuui, and the clearest and most accurate lexical items from all the speakers were
selected for the phonological analysis. Data from all speakers were transcribed and
analyzed using several phonological software programs.

The phonological inventory of Mkuui Daai contains a total of 23 consonants, eight
vowels, and two contrastive tones. Each vowel has contrastive length. The syllable
structure is [(C 1 ) V ( ː ) (C 2 ) (ʔ)]. Thus, there are only 6 types of syllables: V, VC,
CV, CVC, CVːC and CVCʔ. There are three contrastive presyllables: the prenasals
[m-] and [ŋ-], and the prevelar [k-]. The two contrastive tones are Mid Tone ( M ) and
High Tone ( H ). The mid tone has two allotones, mid tone ( M ) and mid falling tone ( F ).
The mid falling allotone only occurs at the end of the word and can be analysed as a
combination of mid tone + a phonetic low tone. The tone bearing unit (TBU) in
Mkuui is the mora, of which a syllable can have one or two. Moras are assigned only
to the nucleus and to sonorant segments in the coda.

Phonological processes in Mkuui include vowel phenomena and compound word
boundary phenomena. Among these are vowel lengthening, vowel lowering, vowel
raising, nasal coda manner assimilation, nasal coda place assimilation, oral coda co-
articulation, glide lowering, and glide strengthening. In terms of rule ordering, the
only obligatory ordering is between vowel lengthening and mid falling tone rule. The
vowel lengthening must precedes mid falling tone rule.","Daai Chin, Sino-Tibetan, dataset, word list, "

on the other hand, to compare rhythmic structure between multiple vocalizations. These

Fourier transform, auto- and cross-correlation, phase portraits, and circular statistics.
Using computer-generated data, we apply a range of techniques, walking the reader
through the necessary software and its functions. We describe which techniques are
most appropriate to test particular hypotheses on rhythmic structure, and provide pos-
sible interpretations of the tests. These techniques can be equally well applied to find
rhythmic structure in gesture, movement, and any other behavior developing over time,
when the research focus lies on its temporal structure. This introduction to quantitative
techniques for rhythm and timing analysis will hopefully spur additional comparative re-

Progovac2016,"In making an argument for the antiquity of language, based on comparative evidence,
Dediu and Levinson (2013) express hope that some combinations of structural features
will prove so conservative that they will allow deep linguistic reconstruction. I propose
that the earliest stages of syntax/grammar as reconstructed in Progovac (2015a), based
on a theoretical and data-driven linguistic analysis, provide just such a conservative
platform, which would have been commanded also by Neandertals and the common
ancestor. I provide a fragment of this proto-grammar, which includes flat verb-noun
compounds used for naming and insult (e.g., rattle-snake, cry-baby, scatter-brain), and
paratactic (loose) combinations of such flat structures (e.g., Come one, come all; You
seek, you find). This flat, binary, paratactic platform is found in all languages, and can
be shown to serve as foundation for any further structure building. However, given
the degree and nature of variation across languages in elaborating syntax beyond this
proto-stage, I propose that hierarchical syntax did not emerge once and uniformly
in all its complexity, but rather multiple times, either within Africa, or after dispersion
from Africa. If so, then, under the uniregional hypothesis, our common ancestor with
Neandertals, H. heidelbergensis, could not have commanded hierarchical syntax, but
“only” the proto-grammar. Linguistic reconstructions of this kind are necessary for
formulating precise and testable hypotheses regarding language evolution. In addition
to the hominin timeline, this reconstruction can also engage, and negotiate between, the
fields of neuroscience and genetics, as I illustrate with one specific scenario involving
FOXP2 gene.","language origin, language evolution, Neandertal, proto grammar, speculation"

Speckmann2010,"Statistical data associated with geographic regions is nowadays globally available in large amounts and hence automated
methods to visually display these data are in high demand. There are several well-established thematic map types for quantitative data
on the ratio-scale associated with regions: choropleth maps, cartograms, and proportional symbol maps. However, all these maps
suffer from limitations, especially if large data values are associated with small regions. To overcome these limitations, we propose
a novel type of quantitative thematic map, the necklace map. In a necklace map, the regions of the underlying two-dimensional map
are projected onto intervals on a one-dimensional curve (the necklace) that surrounds the map regions. Symbols are scaled such
that their area corresponds to the data of their region and placed without overlap inside the corresponding interval on the necklace.
Necklace maps appear clear and uncluttered and allow for comparatively large symbol sizes. They visualize data sets well which are
not proportional to region sizes. The linear ordering of the symbols along the necklace facilitates an easy comparison of symbol sizes.
One map can contain several nested or disjoint necklaces to visualize clustered data. The advantages of necklace maps come at a
price: the association between a symbol and its region is weaker than with other types of maps. Interactivity can help to strengthen
this association if necessary. We present an automated approach to generate necklace maps which allows the user to interactively
control the final symbol placement. We validate our approach with experiments using various data sets and maps.","necklace maps, visualization, geography, "

subject to continuing debate. An import function of the nose and nasal cavity is to condition
inspired air before it reaches the lower respiratory tract. For this reason, it is thought the
observed differences in nose shape among populations are not simply the result of genetic
drift, but may be adaptations to climate. To address the question of whether local adaptation
to climate is responsible for nose shape divergence across populations, we use Qst–Fst
comparisons to show that nares width and alar base width are more differentiated across
populations than expected under genetic drift alone. To test whether this differentiation is
due to climate adaptation, we compared the spatial distribution of these variables with the
global distribution of temperature, absolute humidity, and relative humidity. We find that
width of the nares is correlated with temperature and absolute humidity, but not with relative
humidity. We conclude that some aspects of nose shape may indeed have been driven by
local adaptation to climate. However, we think that this is a simplified explanation of a very
complex evolutionary history, which possibly also involved other non-neutral forces such as
sexual selection.","human prehistory, biological evolution, nose shape, adaptation, climate"

Kauhanen2017,"Language change is neutral if the probability of a language learner adopting any given linguistic variant only depends on the frequency of that variant in the learner’s environment. Ruling out non-neutral motivations of change, be they sociolinguistic, computational, articulatory or functional, a theory of neutral change insists that at least some instances of language change are essentially due to random drift, demographic noise and the social dynamics of finite populations; consequently, it has remained little investigated in the historical and sociolinguistics literature, which has generally been on the lookout for more substantial causes of change. Indeed, recent computational studies have argued that a neutral mechanism cannot give rise to ‘well-behaved’ time series of change which would align with historical data, for instance to generate S-curves. In this paper, I point out a methodological shortcoming of those studies and introduce a mathematical model of neutral change which represents the language community as a dynamic, evolving network of speakers. With computer simulations and a quantitative operationalization of what it means for change to be well-behaved, I show that this model exhibits well-behaved neutral change provided that the language community is suitably clusterized. Thus, neutral change is not only possible but is in fact a characteristic emergent property of a class of social networks. From a theoretical point of view, this finding implies that neutral theories of change deserve more (serious) consideration than they have traditionally received in diachronic and variationist linguistics. Methodologically, it urges that if change is to be successfully modelled, some of the traditional idealizing assumptions employed in much mathematical modelling must be done away with.","language change, language model, neutral evolution, explanation of language change, simulation studies"

Baxter2017,"We use a mathematical model to examine three phenomena involving language
change across the lifespan: the apparent time construct, the adolescent peak, and
two different patterns of individual change. The apparent time construct is
attributed to a decline in flexibility toward language change over one’s lifetime;
this explanation is borne out in our model. The adolescent peak has been explained
by social networks: children interact more with caregivers a generation older until
later childhood and adolescence. We find that the peak also occurs with many
other network structures, so the peak is not specifically due to caregiver
interaction. The two patterns of individual change are one in which most
individuals change gradually, following the mean of community change, and
another in which most individuals have more categorical behavior and change
rapidly if they change at all. Our model suggests that they represent different
balances between the differential weighting of competing variants and degree of
accommodation to other speakers.","language change, modeling, individual language change, "

DeSmet2017,"This paper hypothesizes that as an expression becomes more frequent in one
grammatical context, its mental retrievability improves, which in turn makes it
more easily available in different yet closely related (analogous) grammatical
contexts. Such a mechanism can account for the progression of gradual change.
The hypothesis generates two testable predictions. First, innovative constructions
should be more likely to emerge if their analogical models are better entrenched.
Second, an expression’s retrievability can also be improved by priming, which in
the short term should have a similar effect to entrenchment. These predictions are
tested against the development of the noun key into an adjective (as in a very
key argument). The change is gradual, starting with increased productivity of
compounds with key as specifying element, leading later to debonded and clearly
adjectival uses. The development of key is analyzed using data from the British
Houses of Parliament. The effect of entrenchment is tested against individual
variation. Next, situations are investigated where key has been primed, either by an
earlier instance of key or by a collocate of key. The evidence supports the
hypothesis. Innovative uses of key are favored under conditions that improve the
retrievability of its more conventionalized uses.","productivity, compounding, grammaticalization, language change, gradual change, analogy"

Yang2017,"We estimated the divergence time between Tibetan and Han populations using the conventional FST-based approach (17) (SI Appendix, Text S1). As described above, there were 3,008 Tibetan and 373 Han subjects collected from the TP after QC. We included in this analysis an additional set of 1,726 Han subjects collected from the Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University (WZ) after QC (Materials and Methods). We used GCTA-GRM to remove cryptic relatedness in the Tibetan and Han samples (note that the Han sample was a combined set of 373 Han subjects from the TP and 1,726 Han subjects from WZ) at a relatedness threshold of 0.05 and retained 1,998 unrelated Tibetan and 2,059 unrelated Han subjects. There was no genetic difference between WZ-Han and TP-Han as shown by PCA (SI Appendix, Fig. S3), probably because most of the Han subjects, collected from either TP or WZ, were originally from diverse regions of China. The genome-wide mean FST between Tibetans and Han was 0.012 [using the method by Weir and Cockerham (18) implemented in GCTA], consistent with the estimate of the Han subjects from the HGDP (SI Appendix, Table S1). Given the genome-wide mean FST value (Materials and Methods), we estimated that the divergence time between Tibetan and Han populations was 189 generations. Assuming an average generation time of 25 y as in previous studies (3, 19), this estimate suggests that Tibetans and Han split about 4,725 y ago, ∼2,000 y earlier than that estimated from whole-exome sequencing data (3) but consistent with recent evidence from archeological studies (20, 21).

We conduct a genome-wide study of 7.3 million genotyped and imputed SNPs of 3,008 Tibetans and 7,287 non-Tibetan individuals of Eastern Asian ancestry. Using this large dataset, we detect signals of high-altitude adaptation at nine genomic loci, of which seven are unique. The alleles under natural selection at two of these loci [methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and EPAS1] are strongly associated with blood-related phenotypes, such as hemoglobin, homocysteine, and folate in Tibetans. The folate-increasing allele of rs1801133 at the MTHFR locus has an increased frequency in Tibetans more than expected under a drift model, which is probably a consequence of adaptation to high UV radiation.

Holm2017,"Despite dozens of hypotheses, the origin and development of the Indo-European language family are
still under debate. A well-known glottochronological approach to this problem using Bayesian
computation of language divergence dates claims to have provided evidence for the period of Neolithic
expansion known as the “Anatolian hypothesis.” The dates have met with considerable criticism from
other disciplines. I decided to investigate the evidence for these dates by replicating and analyzing the
approach. During this process, a further approach located a date of origin from between 3950 – 4740
BC. One of the insights of this study was that previous results were significantly disrupted by poorly
attested languages, which were consistently removed step by step.
This paper supports this finding using data from the previous approaches and my own updated
dataset. The resulting date is around 4800 BC. However, the topology of the trees differed considerably
over the course of several hundreds of tests. This problem was avoided in previous approaches by
rigorous topological forcing. Here we apply a west–east dichotomy from a previous purely
lexicostatistical (i.e. without times) approach based on the best available Indo-European dataset of
approx. 1,100 verbal roots, which produces dates around 4100 BC. These dates reflect the most recent
state of knowledge in linguistics, archeology and genetics in favor of the Steppe hypothesis. A new
synopsis of the wheel problem, a primary argument for the divergence date, shows that not one but
three different Indo-European denotations coincide in different areas with different types of wheel–axle
constructions. Archeological cultures likely to have been affected by the migrations are presented

Guilherme2016,"Over the history of mankind, textual records change. Sometimes due to mistakes during transcription, sometimes on purpose, as a way to rewrite facts and reinterpret history. There are several classical cases, such as the logarithmic tables, and the transmission of antique and medieval scholarship. Today, text documents are largely edited and redistributed on the Web. Articles on news portals and collaborative platforms (such as Wikipedia), source code, posts on social networks, and even scientific publications or literary works are some examples in which textual content can be subject to changes in an evolutionary process. In this scenario, given a set of near-duplicate documents, it is worthwhile to find which one is the original and the history of changes that created the whole set. Such functionality would have immediate applications on news tracking services, detection of plagiarism, textual criticism, and copyright enforcement, for instance. However, this is not an easy task, as textual features pointing to the documents’ evolutionary direction may not be evident and are often dataset dependent. Moreover, side information, such as time stamps, are neither always available nor reliable. In this paper, we propose a framework for reliably reconstructing text phylogeny trees, and seamlessly exploring new approaches on a wide range of scenarios of text reusage. We employ and evaluate distinct combinations of dissimilarity measures and reconstruction strategies within the proposed framework, and evaluate each approach with extensive experiments, including a set of artificial near-duplicate documents with known phylogeny, and from documents collected from Wikipedia, whose modifications were made by Internet users. We also present results from qualitative experiments in two different applications: text plagiarism and reconstruction of evolutionary trees for manuscripts (stemmatology).","phylogenetic reconstruction, documents, stemmatics, "

Hothorn2006,"Recursive binary partitioning is a popular tool for regression analysis. Two fundamental
problems of exhaustive search procedures usually applied to fit such models have been known
for a long time: overfitting and a selection bias towards covariates with many possible splits
or missing values. While pruning procedures are able to solve the overfitting problem, the
variable selection bias still seriously affects the interpretability of tree-structured regression
models. For some special cases unbiased procedures have been suggested, however lacking a
common theoretical foundation. We propose a unified framework for recursive partitioning
which embeds tree-structured regression models into a well defined theory of conditional
inference procedures. Stopping criteria based on multiple test procedures are implemented and
it is shown that the predictive performance of the resulting trees is as good as the performance
of established exhaustive search procedures. It turns out that the partitions and therefore
the models induced by both approaches are structurally different, confirming the need for an
unbiased variable selection. Moreover, it is shown that the prediction accuracy of trees with
early stopping is equivalent to the prediction accuracy of pruned trees with unbiased variable
selection. The methodology presented here is applicable to all kinds of regression problems,

both syllable- and stress-related phenomena can be accounted for with a single
set of representations, if traditional syllabic analysis is modified in one central
respect: what is traditionally taken to be a coda-onset cluster is interpreted as two
independent onsets enclosing an empty nucleus. Accordingly, our proposal may
be understood as a development of the idea that underlies classical metrical grids,
i.e. that stress-relevant units project to higher levels and are therefore visible for
stress. The units in the proposal made here, however, are uniformly nuclei.
Contentful nuclei are always projected, while their empty counterparts (i.e. codas
in traditional approaches) may or may not be. The weightlessness of onsets

explains why there is a limit on consonant clusters: the intervening empty

the main stress' (enclitics provide exceptions), (ii) it is rhythmic, i.e.
evenly distributed, and clashes are avoided (in cliticisation at least one
unstressed mora must separate two stresses) and (iii) it fails to exhibit any

stress and the syllable and (iii) the homogeneous character of the units that
are counted by stress algorithms (only nuclei). Onsets cannot possibly
contribute a mora, since they are by definition followed by a pronounced

by an unpronounced nucleus, which may or may not be moraic, i.e. it is

Argue2017,"Although the diminutive Homo floresiensis has been known for a decade, its phylogenetic status remains
highly contentious. A broad range of potential explanations for the evolution of this species has been
explored. One view is that H. floresiensis is derived from Asian Homo erectus that arrived on Flores and
subsequently evolved a smaller body size, perhaps to survive the constrained resources they faced in a
new island environment. Fossil remains of H. erectus, well known from Java, have not yet been discovered
on Flores. The second hypothesis is that H. floresiensis is directly descended from an early Homo lineage
with roots in Africa, such as Homo habilis; the third is that it is Homo sapiens with pathology. We use
parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic methods to test these hypotheses. Our phylogenetic data build
upon those characters previously presented in support of these hypotheses by broadening the range of
traits to include the crania, mandibles, dentition, and postcrania of Homo and Australopithecus. The new
data and analyses support the hypothesis that H. floresiensis is an early Homo lineage: H. floresiensis is
sister either to H. habilis alone or to a clade consisting of at least H. habilis, H. erectus, Homo ergaster, and
H. sapiens. A close phylogenetic relationship between H. floresiensis and H. erectus or H. sapiens can be
rejected; furthermore, most of the traits separating H. floresiensis from H. sapiens are not readily
attributable to pathology (e.g., Down syndrome). The results suggest H. floresiensis is a long-surviving
relict of an early (>1.75 Ma) hominin lineage and a hitherto unknown migration out of Africa, and not
a recent derivative of either H. erectus or H. sapiens.","homo floresiensis, homo sapiens, archaeology, phylogenetics, human prehistory, maximum parsimony"

Prochazka2017,"Many of the world’s around 6,000 languages are in danger of disappearing as people give up use of a minority language in favor of the majority language in a process called language shift. Language shift can be monitored on a large scale through the use of mathematical models by way of differential equations, for example, reaction–diffusion equations. Here, we use a different approach: we propose a model for language dynamics based on the principles of cellular automata/agent-based modeling and combine it with very detailed empirical data. Our model makes it possible to follow language dynamics over space and time, whereas existing models based on differential equations average over space and consequently provide no information on local changes in language use. Additionally, cellular automata models can be used even in cases where models based on differential equations are not applicable, for example, in situations where one language has become dispersed and retreated to language islands. Using data from a bilingual region in Austria, we show that the most important factor in determining the spread and retreat of a language is the interaction with speakers of the same language. External factors like bilingual schools or parish language have only a minor influence.

What we can learn from it is that in order to test certain questions, we do not need to have the good or best or most complex models, but rather simply some good data with which we could compare the results of the evaluation, since, in this way, we could then test which are the factors that make the model more closely mimick reality.","simulation studies, demography, Austrian dialects, bilingualism, "

The numbers range from 27,000 lemmas for the lowest 5% to 52,000 for the highest 5%. Between the ages of 20 and 60, the average person learns 6,000 extra lemmas or about one new lemma every 2 days.

Ullah2015,"Species tree reconstruction has been a subject of substantial research due to its central role across biology and medicine. A species tree is often reconstructed using a set of gene trees or by directly using sequence data. In either of these cases, one of the main confounding phenomena is the discordance between a species tree and a gene tree due to evolutionary events such as duplications and losses. Probabilistic methods can resolve the discordance by coestimating gene trees and the species tree but this approach poses a scalability problem for larger data sets. We present MixTreEM-DLRS: A two-phase approach for reconstructing a species tree in the presence of gene duplications and losses. In the first phase, MixTreEM, a novel structural expectation maximization algorithm based on a mixture model is used to reconstruct a set of candidate species trees, given sequence data for monocopy gene families from the genomes under study. In the second phase, PrIME-DLRS, a method based on the DLRS model (Åkerborg O, Sennblad B, Arvestad L, Lagergren J. 2009. Simultaneous Bayesian gene tree reconstruction and reconciliation analysis. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 106(14):5714–5719), is used for selecting the best species tree. PrIME-DLRS can handle multicopy gene families since DLRS, apart from modeling sequence evolution, models gene duplication and loss using a gene evolution model (Arvestad L, Lagergren J, Sennblad B. 2009. The gene evolution model and computing its associated probabilities. J ACM. 56(2):1–44). We evaluate MixTreEM-DLRS using synthetic and biological data, and compare its performance with a recent genome-scale species tree reconstruction method PHYLDOG (Boussau B, Szöllősi GJ, Duret L, Gouy M, Tannier E, Daubin V. 2013. Genome-scale coestimation of species and gene trees. Genome Res. 23(2):323–330) as well as with a fast parsimony-based algorithm Duptree (Wehe A, Bansal MS, Burleigh JG, Eulenstein O. 2008. Duptree: a program for large-scale phylogenetic analyses using gene tree parsimony. Bioinformatics 24(13):1540–1541). Our method is competitive with PHYLDOG in terms of accuracy and runs significantly faster and our method outperforms Duptree in accuracy. The analysis constituted by MixTreEM without DLRS may also be used for selecting the target species tree, yielding a fast and yet accurate algorithm for larger data sets.

Holen2017,"The earliest dispersal of humans into North America is a
contentious subject, and proposed early sites are required to meet
the following criteria for acceptance: (1) archaeological evidence
is found in a clearly defined and undisturbed geologic context;
(2) age is determined by reliable radiometric dating; (3) multiple
lines of evidence from interdisciplinary studies provide consistent
results; and (4) unquestionable artefacts are found in primary
context 1,2 . Here we describe the Cerutti Mastodon (CM) site, an
archaeological site from the early late Pleistocene epoch, where
in situ hammerstones and stone anvils occur in spatio-temporal
association with fragmentary remains of a single mastodon
(Mammut americanum). The CM site contains spiral-fractured
bone and molar fragments, indicating that breakage occured
while fresh. Several of these fragments also preserve evidence of
percussion. The occurrence and distribution of bone, molar and
stone refits suggest that breakage occurred at the site of burial. Five
large cobbles (hammerstones and anvils) in the CM bone bed display
use-wear and impact marks, and are hydraulically anomalous
relative to the low-energy context of the enclosing sandy silt stratum.
230
Th/U radiometric analysis of multiple bone specimens using
diffusion–adsorption–decay dating models indicates a burial date of
130.7 ± 9.4 thousand years ago. These findings confirm the presence
of an unidentified species of Homo at the CM site during the last
interglacial period (MIS 5e; early late Pleistocene), indicating that
humans with manual dexterity and the experiential knowledge
to use hammerstones and anvils processed mastodon limb bones
for marrow extraction and/or raw material for tool production.
Systematic proboscidean bone reduction, evident at the CM site, fits
within a broader pattern of Palaeolithic bone percussion technology
in Africa 3–6 , Eurasia 7–9 and North America 10–12 . The CM site is, to
our knowledge, the oldest in situ, well-documented archaeological
site in North America and, as such, substantially revises the timing

extent to which they resort to morphologically analyzable lexical items? Drawing
on a worldwide sample of 78 languages for which a standard set of 160 mostly
nominal meanings is investigated, the article demonstrates that variability in this
area is indeed profound. Correlations between the relative prevalence of analyzable items in a language with the size of its consonant inventory, the complexity
of its syllable structure, and the length of its nominal roots suggest that, typologically, languages with a simple phonological structure are those in which analyzability in the lexicon is most profound. Possible explanations for this observation
in terms of the avoidance of homonymy and pressure exerted by different linguis-
tic subsystems on each other are discussed.","morphological complexity, semantic motivation, motivation, morphological motivation, phonetic complexity, lexical typology, "
Wichmann2017,"This paper presents properties of a computer simulation of language migration. It takes as input a simulated phylogeny and a database of today’s populated places. At each time step, a language moves within a geographical quadrilateral defined by the minimal number, ch, of choices of populated places within the quadrilateral. The result is a constrained random walk defined by a combination of the ch parameter and the landscape, which comes into play via the restriction of the walk to populated places. The distribution of move distances is qualitatively similar across values of ch and resembles a Gamma distribution. Through comparisons with densities of real-world language families, the values of ch which yield the closest fits between real and simulated data are found.","simulation studies, language change, demography"

The Mayan language Tojol-ab’al displays a mixture of linguistic features from two related Mayan languages, Chuj and Tseltal. The systematic similarities found in related languages not only make it methodologically difficult to identify the source of specific linguistic features but also mean that inherited similarity can alter the processes and outcomes of language mixing in ways that parallel observed patterns of code-switching between related languages. Tojol-ab’al, therefore, arguably represents a distinct type of mixed language, one that may only result from mixture involving related languages.","language mixture, genetic similarity, mixed languages, Mayan languages, comparative method"

Systematic patterns of over- and under-representation of these structures in the lexicon are documented and related to prior research. Beyond the detailed frequency facts presented here, new empirical patterns documented include positional preferences for bilabials and non-labial sonorants, extensions of a known pattern of gradient vowel assimilation, and identification of a role for manner and segment order in consonant co-occurrence restrictions.

the ‘foundations of phonology’, contrary to what is tacitly assumed and appears from some
textbooks. It will be argued that the classical concept phoneme, defi ned as a set of distinctive
features, presents both obsolete and still relevant properties. One of these properties, linearity,
should clearly be abandoned, as follows from acoustic-perceptual evidence as well as from some
types of sound change. Thereby, the phoneme in its purest sense can be said to have been super-
seded by one major trend characterizing post-SPE phonological theory: multilinearity. However,
a phoneme-based property of distinctive features, their locality, is still valid, and is empirically
supported by cross-linguistic variation. Now, locality and non-linearity are apparently contradic-
tory. It will be shown that this contradiction cannot be resolved, and that both feature properties
cannot be captured, unless consonants and vowels are assumed to be universally segregated
within phonological representations. This issue leads to several predictions on C/C and V/V
interactions, converges with independent processual evidence like vowel-to-vowel assimilation,
and addresses the question of the relationship between phonology and morphology.","CVCV, phonology, phonotactics, phonological theory"

Veränderungen in einem Land kann es zu Wandlungsprozessen in bezug auf die
Sprache kommen. Ein solch einschneidendes Erlebnis für den russischen Sprachraum
stellen zweifellos die mit Glasnost' und Perestrojka verbundenen politischen
Umwälzungen dar, die den Zusammenbruch der Sowjetunion zur Folge hatten. Solche
außersprachlichen Faktoren sind natürlich nicht allein verantwortlich für den Wandel
einer Sprache; wenn dies so wäre, könnte der Sprachwandel durchaus als ein leicht zu

crucial methodological tool as an increasing number of studies begin to utilise ‘big data.’ This study
investigates the possibility of taking forced alignment one step further towards the goal of complete

sociolinguistic variables in British English: (th)-fronting, (td)-deletion, and (h)-dropping. This involved the
expansion of pronouncing dictionaries to reflect the surface output of these variable rules; FAVE then
compares the fit of competing acoustic models with the speech signal to determine the surface variant. It does
so with an impressive degree of accuracy, largely comparable to inter-transcriber agreement for all variables;
however, the pattern of its mistakes, which are largely false positives, suggests a difficulty in identifying the
voiceless segments of (td) and (th). Although it is reassuring that inter-transcriber agreement was also lowest
for these tokens, it should be noted that FAVE’s accuracy decreases in faster speech rates while no comparable
effect is found for agreement among human transcribers.","forced alignment, sound alignment, Praat, sociolinguistics, language variation"

Dale2012,"Human language is unparalleled in both its expressive capacity and its diversity. What
accounts for the enormous diversity of human languages [13]? Recent evidence suggests
that the structure of languages may be shaped by the social and demographic environ-
ment in which the languages are learned and used. In an analysis of over 2000 languages
Lupyan and Dale [25] demonstrated that socio-demographic variables, such as popula-
tion size, significantly predicted the complexity of inflectional morphology. Languages
spoken by smaller populations tend to employ more complex inflectional systems. Lan-
guages spoken by larger populations tend to avoid complex morphological paradigms,
employing lexical constructions instead. This relationship may exist because of how
language learning takes place in these different social contexts [44, 45]. In a smaller pop-
ulation, a tightly-knit social group combined with exclusive or almost exclusive language
acquisition by infants permits accumulation of complex inflectional forms. In larger pop-
ulations, adult language learning and more extensive cross-group interactions produce
pressures that lead to morphological simplification. In the current paper, we explore
this learning-based hypothesis in two ways. First, we develop an agent-based simulation
that serves as a simple existence proof: As adult interaction increases, languages lose
inflections. Second, we carry out a correlational study showing that English-speaking
adults who had more interaction with non-native speakers as children showed a relative
preference for over-regularized (i.e. morphologically simpler) forms. The results of the
simulation and experiment lend support to the linguistic niche hypothesis: Languages
may vary in the ways they do in part due to different social environments in which they
are learned and used. In short, languages adapt to the learning constraints and biases
of their learners.","morphological complexity, linguistic niche hypothesis, adaptation, simulation studies"
Dale2012,"Paper has a strong adaptationist view on the origins of morphological complexity and uses simulations to prove the point. To which degree this is true is difficult to say, but the paper is a valuable contribution to the debate about adaptation and linguistic evolution. 

To some extend, the model is self-fulfilling, because their basic assumption is that morphology is difficult to learn. But what about other aspects of language? If we only integrate morphology into the agent model, but exclude other factors, we may as well miss important aspects.","simulation studies, adaptation, morphological complexity"
Katz2016,"This paper argues that processes traditionally classified as lenition fall into at least
two subsets, with distinct phonetic reflexes, formal properties and characteristic
contexts. One type, referred to as loss lenition, frequently neutralises contrasts
in positions where they are perceptually indistinct. The second type, referred to
as continuity lenition, can target segments in perceptually robust positions,
increases the intensity and/or decreases the duration of those segments, and
very rarely results in positional neutralisation of contrasts. While loss lenition
behaves much like other phonological processes, analysing continuity lenition is
difficult or impossible in standard phonological approaches. The paper develops
a phonetically based optimality-theoretic account that explains the typology of
the two types of lenition. The crucial proposal is that, unlike loss lenition, con-
tinuity lenition is driven by constraints that reference multiple prosodic positions.","perception, lenition, sound change, sound change types, neutralisation, "

questions about emotions associated with terms, we show how the inclusion of a word choice question

level (rather than at word level). We conducted experiments on how to formulate the emotion-

one of the target properties can be derived from the other three (e.g. slope is pre-

conflict, and cannot all be realised. The conflict between tone targets is resolved

Edelman2017,"Sequential dependencies in utterances, such as number or gender agreement between noun and verb, can leap over one or more—sometimes, many—intervening words. If the intervening words are all subsumed under the same root in a tree-structured unit, the dependency could be considered short-range, skipping just one unit (this is the case, e.g., in the tree-adjoining grammar or TAG formalism; Joshi and Schabes, 1997). Given that human languages do tend to minimize actual word-level dependency length in their utterances (Futrell et al., 2015), it seems likely that long-range dependencies are indeed psychologically real.

In terms of graph structure, non-local dependencies correspond to several paths that are initially distinct, then traverse the same sequence of items, then part ways again. Tasks with this structure are commonly used in studies of animal navigation (e.g., the 8-maze; Wood et al., 2000). Following a proposal by Levy (1996, fig. 2), Eichenbaum et al. showed that rats can learn to perform an analogous navigation task set in an abstract space of odor sequences (Agster et al., 2002 ;  Fortin et al., 2002).","graph theory, language model, dependencies, "

Shiers2007,"Evolutionary models of languages are usually considered to take the form of trees. With the
development of so-called tree constraints the plausibility of the tree model assumptions can be
assessed by checking whether the moments of observed variables lie within regions consistent with
Gaussian latent tree models. In our linguistic application, the data set comprises acoustic samples
(audio recordings) from speakers of five Romance languages or dialects. The aim is to assess these
functional data for compatibility with a hereditary tree model at the language level. A novel
combination of canonical function analysis (CFA) with a separable covariance structure produces a
representative basis for the data. The separable-CFA basis is formed of components which emphasize
language differences whilst maintaining the integrity of the observational language-groupings. A
previously unexploited Gaussian tree constraint is then applied to component-by- component
projections of the data to investigate adherence to an evolutionary tree. The results highlight some
aspects of Romance language speech that appear compatible with an evolutionary tree model but
indicate that it would be inappropriate to model all features as such.","canonical function analysis, Romance, speech acoustics, phylogenetic reconstruction"

Lu2016,"The origin of Tibetans remains one of the most contentious puzzles in history, anthropology, and genetics. Analyses of deeply sequenced
(303–603) genomes of 38 Tibetan highlanders and 39 Han Chinese lowlanders, together with available data on archaic and modern
humans, allow us to comprehensively characterize the ancestral makeup of Tibetans and uncover their origins. Non-modern human
sequences compose ~6% of the Tibetan gene pool and form unique haplotypes in some genomic regions, where Denisovan-like, Nean-
derthal-like, ancient-Siberian-like, and unknown ancestries are entangled and elevated. The shared ancestry of Tibetan-enriched
sequences dates back to ~62,000–38,000 years ago, predating the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and representing early colonization
of the plateau. Nonetheless, most of the Tibetan gene pool is of modern human origin and diverged from that of Han Chinese
~15,000 to ~9,000 years ago, which can be largely attributed to post-LGM arrivals. Analysis of ~200 contemporary populations showed
that Tibetans share ancestry with populations from East Asia (~82%), Central Asia and Siberia (~11%), South Asia (~6%), and western
Eurasia and Oceania (~1%). Our results support that Tibetans arose from a mixture of multiple ancestral gene pools but that their origins
are much more complicated and ancient than previously suspected. We provide compelling evidence of the co-existence of Paleolithic
and Neolithic ancestries in the Tibetan gene pool, indicating a genetic continuity between pre-historical highland-foragers and present-
day Tibetans. In particular, highly differentiated sequences harbored in highlanders’ genomes were most likely inherited from pre-LGM
settlers of multiple ancestral origins (SUNDer) and maintained in high frequency by natural selection.","Sino-Tibetan, Tibetan, population genetics, dating, "

StuddertKennedy2017,"We review Berwick and Chomsky’s Why Only Us, Language and Evolution, a book premised on lan-
guage as an instrument primarily of thought, only secondarily of communication. The authors con-
clude that a Universal Grammar can be reduced to three biologically isolated components, whose
computational system for syntax was the result of a single mutation that occurred about 80,000 years
ago. We question that argument because it ignores the origin of words, even though Berwick and
Chomsky acknowledge that words evolved before grammar. It also fails to explain what evolutionary
problem language uniquely solved (Wallace’s question). To answer that question, we review recent
discoveries about the ontogeny and phylogeny of words. Ontogenetically, two modes of nonverbal re-
lation between infant and mother begin at or within 6 months of birth that are crucial antecedents of
the infant’s first words: intersubjectivity and joint attention. Intersubjectivity refers to rhythmic shared
affect between infant and caretaker(s) that develop during the first 6 months. When the infant begins
to crawl, they begin to attend jointly to environmental objects. Phylogenetically, Hrdy and Bickerton
describe aspects of Homo erectus’ ecology and cognition that facilitated the evolution of words. Hrdy
shows how cooperative breeding established trust between infant and caretakers, laying the ground-
work for a community of mutual trust among adults. Bickerton shows how ‘confrontational scaveng-
ing’ led to displaced reference, whereby an individual communicated the nature of a dead animal and
its location to members of the group that could not see it. Thus, both phylogenetically and ontogenet-
ically, the original function of language was primarily an instrument of communication. Rejecting
Berwick and Chomsky’s answer to Wallace’s question that syntax afforded better planning and infer-
ence, we endorse Bickerton’s view that language enabled speakers to refer to objects not immediately
present. Thus arose context-free mental representations, unique to human language and thought.","Wallace's question, Noam Chomsky, language origin, universal grammar"
Kelly2017,"Lateral transfer, a process whereby species exchange evolutionary traits through non-
ancestral relationships, is a frequent source of model misspecification in phylogenetic
inference. Lateral transfer obscures the phylogenetic signal in the data — the signal
of the taxa ancestry — as the histories of affected traits are mosaics of the species
phylogeny and may conflict with the underlying phylogeny. We control for the
effect of lateral transfer in a Stochastic Dollo model and a Bayesian setting. We infer
rooted phylogenetic trees. Our likelihood is highly intractable as its parameters
are given by the solution of a sequence of systems of differential equations which
represent the expected evolution of traits along a tree and grow exponentially in
dimension with the number of taxa under consideration. We construct an accurate
parameter approximation framework, and from this we derive an efficient exact-
approximate inference scheme. We illustrate our method on data sets of lexical traits
in Eastern Polynesian and Indo-European languages and obtain improved fits over
the corresponding model without lateral transfer.","lateral transfer, lexical borrowing, stochastic Dollo model, Bayesian inference, Eastern Polynesian, Indo-European"

Parker2002,"A long-standing controversy in the interface between phonetics and
phonology involves the nature of sonority. This dissertation seeks to help
resolve this problem by showing that the sonority hierarchy is both physically
and psychologically real. This is accomplished by reporting the results of two
rigorous and in-depth experiments. The first of these involves phonetic
(instrumental) measurements of five acoustic and aerodynamic correlates of
sonority in English and Spanish: intensity, frequency of the first formant, total
segmental duration, peak intraoral air pressure, and combined oral plus nasal air
flow. Intensity values are found to consistently yield a correlation of at least .97
with typical sonority indices. Consequently, sonority is best defined in terms of
a linear regression equation derived from the observed intensity results.

The second major experiment — this one psycholinguistic in nature —
involves a common process of playful reduplication in English. A list of 99
hypothetical rhyming pairs such as roshy-toshy was evaluated by 332 native
speakers. Their task was to judge which order sounds more natural, e.g., roshytoshy or toshy-roshy. The data again confirm the crucial importance of sonority
in accounting for the observed results. Specifically, the unmarked (preferred)
pattern is for the morpheme beginning with the more sonorous segment in each
pair to occur in absolute word-initial position. A generalized version of the
Syllable Contact Law is utilized in the formal analysis of this phenomenon in
terms of Optimality Theory. Finally, a complete and universal sonority
hierarchy is posited by building on the findings of the two experiments as a
whole.","sonority hierarchy, quantitative analysis, experimental phonetics, "

Zuo2017,"Phytolith remains of rice (Oryza sativa L.) recovered from the Shangshan site in the Lower Yangtze of China have previously been recognized as the earliest examples of rice cultivation. However, because of the poor preservation of macroplant fossils, many radiocarbon dates were derived from undifferentiated organic materials in pottery sherds. These materials remain a source of debate because of potential contamination by old carbon. Direct dating of the rice remains might serve to clarify their age. Here, we first validate the reliability of phytolith dating in the study region through a comparison with dates obtained from other material from the same layer or context. Our phytolith data indicate that rice remains retrieved from early stages of the Shangshan and Hehuashan sites have ages of approximately 9,400 and 9,000 calibrated years before the present, respectively. The morphology of rice bulliform phytoliths indicates they are closer to modern domesticated species than to wild species, suggesting that rice domestication may have begun at Shangshan during the beginning of the Holocene. 

**Significance**

When the domestication of rice began in its homeland, China, is an enduring and important issue of debate for researchers from many different disciplines. Reliable chronological and robust identification criteria for rice domestication are keys to understanding the issue. Here, we first use phytolith dating to constrain the initial occupation of Shangshan, an important site with early rice remains located in the Lower Yangtze region of China. We then identify the rice phytoliths of Shangshan as partly domesticated based on their morphological characteristics. The results indicate that rice domestication may have begun at Shangshan in the Lower Yangtze during the beginning of the Holocene. ","rice cultivation, China, archaeology, carbon-14 dating, "

The earliest Middle Stone Age assemblages come from eastern and southern Africa but date much earlier5, 6, 7. Here we report the ages, determined by thermoluminescence dating, of fire-heated flint artefacts obtained from new excavations at the Middle Stone Age site of Jebel Irhoud, Morocco, which are directly associated with newly discovered remains of H. sapiens8. A weighted average age places these Middle Stone Age artefacts and fossils at 315 ± 34 thousand years ago. Support is obtained through the recalculated uranium series with electron spin resonance date of 286 ± 32 thousand years ago for a tooth from the Irhoud 3 hominin mandible. These ages are also consistent with the faunal and microfaunal9 assemblages and almost double the previous age estimates for the lower part of the deposits10, 11. The north African site of Jebel Irhoud contains one of the earliest directly dated Middle Stone Age assemblages, and its associated human remains are the oldest reported for H. sapiens.

Since the environments are not complementary there is no way to unite these six partially
overlapping sets. But it is also impossible to set up six different proto-segments. For we may
be fairly con dent that no human language has or ever has had six distinct vowels in this
narrow region of the vowel space. So is this perhaps a sound change that has not proceeded [pb]

on a segmental basis but on a word-by-word basis, captured at different points in its
progression through the lexicon? No. It is clear that the distribution is not random but shows
a distinct tendency for æ to be more common in the most easterly points and a to become
more frequent as one moves west. In fact, the vowel in question in all of these forms goes
back to Middle English a. The native dialectal re ex is a, but the Standard English re ex was
æ, as it still is across the board in General American. Since the more eastern parts of Cornwall
are in contact with other English dialects having æ, it is probable that the speech of these

of the Chinese script. Comparative evidence from other early logographic writing systems
as well as evidence from later stages of Chinese both support this argument, and provide an

assignment triggered by size”. The metric is tested on a sample of 84 African languages,
organized in subsamples of genealogically related languages. The results of the investigation
show that: (1) the gender systems of the sampled languages lean towards high complexity
scores; (2) languages with purely semantic gender assignment tend to lack pervasive gender
indexation; (3) languages with a high number of gender distinctions tend to exhibit
pervasive gender indexation; (4) some of the uses of manipulable gender assignment are
only attested in languages with a high number of gender distinctions and/or pervasive
indexation. With respect to the distribution of the gender complexity scores, the results
show that genealogically related languages tend to have the same or similar gender
complexity scores. Languages that display exceedingly low or high gender complexity scores
when compared with closely related languages exhibit distinctive sociolinguistic profiles
(contact, bi- or multilingualism). The implications of these findings for the typology of gender
systems and the crosslinguistic study of grammatical complexity and its distribution are

Previous production studies have shown that the devoicing of initial labiodental fricatives is a change in progress in the Dutch language area. We present the results of a speeded identification task in which fricative stimuli were systematically varied for two phonetic cues, voicing and duration. Listeners (n=100) were regionally stratified, and the regions (k=5) reflect different stages of this sound change in progress. Voicing turned out to be the strongest categorization cue in all regions; duration only played a minor role. Regional differences showed up in the perception of the consonantal contrast that matched regional differences in production reported in previous studies. The addition of random slopes in the mixed model regression showed the importance of within-regional variation.","sound change, consonant change, sound change in progress, Dutch, Dutch dialects"

The former construction is correct but less used by classical authors; the second is not correct and appears as a kind of “vulgar” Latin. However, the Auctor ad Herennium knew very well the differences, because he uses coeptum est dici (4.30.41) and contra intercedentibis collegis (1.12.21).

From a technical point of view the program consists in extracting from the genetic/lexical distances a set of reconstructed geographical positions to be compared with the real ones. We show that geographical recovering is successful when the genetic/lexical distances are not a simple consequence of phylogenesis but also of horizontal transfers as, for example, vocabulary borrowings between different languages.

Such comparative data is relatively accessible in comparative wordlists which can be displayed in a two-dimensional table ordered by language and gloss [...]. The procedures of lexicostatistics, in fact, are restricted to registering as ""cognates"" lexemes that manifest such semantic euqivalence.

But for the further goals of coparative linguistics -- describing the totality of historical changes affecting the languages, working out the genealogical relationship between the languages, and presenting the complete etymological evidence that justifies these historical relations -- it is necessary to go beyond the obvious s-cognates; one must attempt to establish a full set of cognates. Failure to move beyond the s-cognates artificially restricts the number of discoverable cognates.

The quasi-regular nature of such construction grammars allows them to capture both the rule-like patterns as well as the myriad of exceptions that often are excluded by fiat from the old view built on abstract rules.

Stevens2017,"Animal camouflage is a longstanding example of adaptation. Much research has tested how camouflage prevents detection and recognition, largely focusing on changes to an animal’s own appearance over evolution. However, animals could also substantially alter their camouflage by behaviourally choosing appropriate substrates. Recent studies suggest that individuals from several animal taxa could select backgrounds or positions to improve concealment. Here, we test whether individual wild animals choose backgrounds in complex environments, and whether this improves camouflage against predator vision. We studied nest site selection by nine species of ground-nesting birds (nightjars, plovers and coursers) in Zambia, and used image analysis and vision modelling to quantify egg and plumage camouflage to predator vision. Individual birds chose backgrounds that enhanced their camouflage, being better matched to their chosen backgrounds than to other potential backgrounds with respect to multiple aspects of camouflage. This occurred at all three spatial scales tested (a few centimetres and 5 m from the nest, and compared with other sites chosen by conspecifics) and was the case for the eggs of all bird groups studied, and for adult nightjar plumage. Thus, individual wild animals improve their camouflage through active background choice, with choices highly refined across multiple spatial scales.","animal camouflage, mimicry, animals, "
Stevens2017,"In its essence, this paper means that some birds know how they look, as otherwise they could not chose the best way to hide when breeding.

rates of words over the second half of the 20th Century, showing death rates to be strongly affected by
the imposed time cutoff of the arbitrary present and not increasing dramatically. We provide a robust,
principled approach to examining lexical evolution by tracking the volume of word flux across various
relative frequency thresholds. We show that while the overall statistical structure of the English language
remains stable over time in terms of its raw Zipf distribution, we find evidence of an enduring ‘lexical
turbulence’: The flux of words across frequency thresholds from decade to decade scales superlinearly
with word rank and exhibits a scaling break we connect to that of Zipf’s law. To better understand the
changing lexicon, we examine the contributions to the Jensen-Shannon divergence of individual words
crossing frequency thresholds. We also find indications that scholarly works about fiction are strongly
represented in the 2012 English Fiction corpus, and suggest that a future revision of the corpus should

learners and laboratory experiments, that structure arises from a trade-off between pres-

utterances in a language will tend to minimise effort for
the speaker as long as distinctiveness for the hearer is
not compromised (Zipf, 1949). This kind of observation
can be couched in terms of compression, i.e., optimisation
of a repertoire of signals such that the energetic cost of
unambiguously conveying any meaning is minimised.
This leads naturally to the inverse relationship between
frequency and length of words identified by Zipf (1936);

LaBar2016,"A major aim of evolutionary biology is to explain the respective roles of adaptive versus non-
adaptive changes in the evolution of complexity. While selection is certainly responsible for
the spread and maintenance of complex phenotypes, this does not automatically imply that
strong selection enhances the chance for the emergence of novel traits, that is, the origina-
tion of complexity. Population size is one parameter that alters the relative importance of
adaptive and non-adaptive processes: as population size decreases, selection weakens
and genetic drift grows in importance. Because of this relationship, many theories invoke a
role for population size in the evolution of complexity. Such theories are difficult to test
empirically because of the time required for the evolution of complexity in biological popula-
tions. Here, we used digital experimental evolution to test whether large or small asexual
populations tend to evolve greater complexity. We find that both small and large—but not
intermediate-sized—populations are favored to evolve larger genomes, which provides the
opportunity for subsequent increases in phenotypic complexity. However, small and large
populations followed different evolutionary paths towards these novel traits. Small popula-
tions evolved larger genomes by fixing slightly deleterious insertions, while large populations
fixed rare beneficial insertions that increased genome size. These results demonstrate that
genetic drift can lead to the evolution of complexity in small populations and that purifying
selection is not powerful enough to prevent the evolution of complexity in large populations.","complexity, evolution of complexity, digital experimental evolution, simulation studies, "

Wagner1996,"he problem of complex adaptations is studied in two largely disconnected research traditions: evolutionary
biology and evolutionary computer science. This paper summarizes the results from both areas and compares their
implications. In evolutionary computer science it was found that the Darwinian process of mutation, recombination
and selection is not universally effective in improving complex systems like computer programs or chip designs. For
adaptation to occur, these systems must possess ""evolvability,"" i.e., the ability of random variations to sometimes
produce improvement. It was found that evolvability critically depends on the way genetic variation maps onto
phenotypic variation, an issue known as the representation problem. The genotype-phenotype map determines the
variability of characters, which is the propensity to vary. Variability needs to be distinguished from variations, which
are the actually realized differences between individuals. The genotype-phenotype map is the common theme underlying
such varied biological phenomena as genetic canalization, developmental constraints, biological versatility, devel-
opmental dissociability, and morphological integration. For evolutionary biology the representation problem has im-
portant implications: how is it that extant species acquired a genotype-phenotype map which allows improvement by
mutation and selection? Is the genotype-phenotype map able to change in evolution? What are the selective forces,
if any, that shape the genotype-phenotype map? We propose that the genotype-phenotype map can evolve by two
main routes: epistatic mutations, or the creation of new genes. A common result for organismic design is modularity.
By modularity we mean a genotype-phenotype map in which there are few pleiotropic effects among characters serving
different functions, with pleiotropic effects falling mainly among characters that are part of a single functional complex.
Such a design is expected to improve evolvability by limiting the interference between the adaptation of different
functions. Several population genetic models are reviewed that are intended to explain the evolutionary origin of a
modular design. While our current knowledge is insufficient to assess the plausibility of these models, they form the
beginning of a framework for understanding the evolution of the genotype-phenotype map.","adaptation, natural selection, neutral evolution, "

Murawaki2015,"Phylogenetic models, originally developed to demonstrate evolutionary biology, have been applied to a wide range of cultural data including natural language lexicons, manuscripts, folktales, material cultures, and religions. A fundamental question regarding the application of phylogenetic inference is whether trees are an appropriate approximation of cultural evolutionary history. Their validity in cultural applications has been scrutinized, particularly with respect to the lexicons of dialects in contact. Phylogenetic models organize evolutionary data into a series of branching events through time. However, branching events are typically not included in dialectological studies to interpret the distributions of lexical terms. Instead, dialectologists have offered spatial interpretations to represent lexical data. For example, new lexical items that emerge in a politico-cultural center are likely to spread to peripheries, but not vice versa. To explore the question of the tree model’s validity, we present a simple simulation model in which dialects form a spatial network and share lexical items through contact rather than through common ancestors. We input several network topologies to the model to generate synthetic data. We then analyze the synthesized data using conventional phylogenetic techniques. We found that a group of dialects can be considered tree-like even if it has not evolved in a temporally tree-like manner but has a temporally invariant, spatially tree-like structure. In addition, the simulation experiments appear to reproduce unnatural results observed in reconstructed trees for real data. These results motivate further investigation into the spatial structure of the evolutionary history of dialect lexicons as well as other cultural characteristics.","Japanese, Japonic, dialectology, Japanese dialects, family tree, network, wave theory, simulation studies"
Murawaki2015,"Paper naively simulates language change in a network fashion as an exchange of words between neighboring dialects which are connected via links in a network. It shows that phylogenetic analyses can nevertheless infer a tree with low reticulation rates (using the distance-based approach with delta-scores in Neighbor-Net), if the network shows a strong division with bottlenecks in the data. This is on the one hand clear, on the other hand also interesting, but it seems like there are certain shortcomings in the findings: (a) the model for simulation is really simple and not convincingly explained, (b) it is not clear to which the approach assumes that dialects change themselves without even being in contact with other varieties, (c) it is questionable how appropriate it is to derive these findings from using NeighborNet: distance-based methods are forcing things heaviliy into a tree, so maybe this is not that big a thing to wonder about.

On the other hand, the very idea to investigate data which has not been created by a tree-process and testing what phylogenetic algorithms do with it, is an interesting one, and it should be pursued further.","phylogenetic reconstruction, dialect network, simulation studies, Japonic, Japanese dialects, family tree, tree-likeness"

Gontier2017a,"Modern evolutionary biology is currently characterized by epistemological divergence
because, beyond organisms and genes, scholars nowadays investigate a plurality of units of
evolution, they recognize multilevel selection, and especially from within the Extended
Synthesis, scholars have identified a plurality of evolutionary mechanisms that besides
natural selection can explain how the evolution of anatomical form and functional
behavior occur. Evolutionary linguists have also implicated a multitude of units, levels and
mechanisms involved in (aspects of) language evolution, which has also brought forth
epistemological divergence on how language possibly evolved. Here, we examine how a
general evolutionary methodology can become abstracted from how biologists study
evolution, and how this methodology can become implemented into the field of Evolu-

mechanisms (means whereby evolution occurs) of language evolution, allocating them into
ontological hierarchies, and distinguishing them from other kinds of evolution. In this paper

Although the among-population variances are relatively small, the genetic components for Tibetan,

Wichmann2017a,"Different methods exist for classifying languages, depending on whether the task is to work out the relations among languages already known to be related—internal language classification—or whether the task is to establish that certain languages are related—external language classification.

The comparative method in historical linguistics, developed during the latter part of the 19th century, represents one method for internal language classification; lexicostatistics, developed during the 1950s, represents another. Elements of lexicostatistics have been transformed and carried over into modern computational linguistic phylogenetics, and currently efforts are also being made to automate the comparative method. Recent years have seen rapid progress in the development of methods, tools, and resources for language classification. For instance, computational phylogenetic algorithms and software have made it possible to handle the classification of many languages using explicit models of language change, and data have been gathered for two thirds of the world’s language, allowing for rapid, exploratory classifications. There are also many open questions and venues for future research, for instance: What are the real-world counterparts to the nodes in a family tree structure? How can shortcomings in the traditional method of comparative historical linguistics be overcome? How can the understanding of the results that computational linguistic phylogenetics have to offer be improved?

External language classification, a notoriously difficult task, has also benefitted from the advent of computational power. While, in the past, the simultaneous comparison of many languages for the purpose of discovering deep genealogical links was carried out in a haphazard fashion, leaving too much room for the effect of chance similarities to kick in, this sort of activity can now be done in a systematic, objective way on an unprecedented scale. The ways of producing final, convincing evidence for a deep genealogical relation, however, have not changed much. There is some room for improvement in this area, but even more room for improvement in the way that proposals for long-distance relations are evaluated.

the scope of existing constructional approaches in order to include non-linguistic meaningful behavior. In

**Background**

The generation of multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) is a crucial step for many bioinformatic analyses. Thus improving MSA accuracy and identifying potential errors in MSAs is important for a wide range of post-genomic research. We present a novel method called MergeAlign which constructs consensus MSAs from multiple independent MSAs and assigns an alignment precision score to each column.

**Results**

Using conventional benchmark tests we demonstrate that on average MergeAlign MSAs are more accurate than MSAs generated using any single matrix of sequence substitution. We show that MergeAlign column scores are related to alignment precision and hence provide an ab initio method of estimating alignment precision in the absence of curated reference MSAs. Using two novel and independent alignment performance tests that utilise a large set of orthologous gene families we demonstrate that increasing MSA performance leads to an increase in the performance of downstream phylogenetic analyses.

**Conclusion**

Using multiple tests of alignment performance we demonstrate that this novel method has broad general application in biological research.

the domain of action.
We think Moro’s arguments fail, for
reasons that are worth highlighting, for
both sides of the debate: First, the very
same arguments Moro puts forth could
be raised to argue against a relation-

capacities such as mathematics or music,
although here generative linguists have
in fact been known to promote such
parallelisms, suggesting that they see some
underlying similarity despite the differ-

Fortemps2014,"The problem situations used by Cohors-Fresenborg ( 1978 ) for his Dynamical Mazes
were basically the following: he described verbally a situation and asked the subject
to create a fi nite automaton which would “give the solution.” This author’s word
problems were similar to this one: “Create a machine which will give a stamp for
four coins.” This can be viewed as follows: a list of exits was given (e.g., “more
coins 1,” “more coins 2,” “more coins 3,” “your stamp is available”) and the subject
had to create the fi nite automaton which would yield that list as output. The use of
this device in an NVCD-type approach (Lowenthal, 1984 ; Lowenthal & Lefebvre,

biased. The creation of an ad hoc network has been done previously by trial and

Badir2017,"Arbitrariness is commonly seen as a major concept in Saussure’s thought, and it even receives the status of a “principle” in his theory. It is not only the characteristic feature of the relation between the signifier and the signified (the semiological relation is arbitrary), but moreover it is constitutive of this very relation (the relation is semiological because it is arbitrary; there is a so-called “semiological relation” established between a signifier and a signified because of the principle of arbitrariness). And when linguists and other Saussurean interpreters comment on the concept of arbitrariness, they usually imply a binary relation: the semiological relation is arbitrary due to the fact that the signifier is arbitrarily chosen vis-à-vis the signified, and vice versa. I will be questioning the latter assertion in this paper. In my opinion, the symmetry of the semiological relation has not been properly demonstrated. The signifier can be seen as arbitrary with regard to the signified, but no reason has been provided to recognize the converse. Instead a number of arguments can be put forth to see arbitrariness as a concept that implies a non-symmetrical relation.","Ferdinand de Saussure, arbitrariness, signifier, signified, terminology"

we should admit that what we are looking for in Saussure’s work may no longer

that a non-symmetrical concept of arbitrariness can have great significance. It
throws into question the isomorphism between the expression and the content
we have inherited from Hjelmslev’s theory. Besides, it allows to reconsider the
discrepancy between arbitrary signs, like words, and “motivated signs” as
pictures are supposed to be, especially if the Saussurean notion of arbitrariness
is integrated into Peirce’s triadic theory of sign. I would suggest that pictures
become meaningful when we see how arbitrary they are. A small square on a
screen can be the manifestation of a ball, or a patch of red in a painting by
Picasso the manifestation of a grey coat. This is all a matter of negative values in
a differential system. The struggle against the nomenclaturist – childish but

Those which the editors redrew for inclusion in the Cours de linguistique générale (1916) – in some cases with significant changes – have had a surprisingly strong impact on readers ever since. If Saussure hoped that the drawings would clear up ambiguities in his verbal text, he might have been disappointed; for while they extend a hand to students and readers to guide them into his conceptual world via the stepping-stones of the semi-familiar, accessible and concrete, they have opened up whole new realms of ambiguity, and strengthened the ones already present in the verbal text.

The Tibetan-Yi Corridor located on the eastern edge of Tibetan Plateau is suggested to be the key region for the origin and diversification of Tibeto-Burman speaking populations and the main route of the peopling of the Plateau. However, the genetic history of the populations in the Corridor is far from clear due to limited sampling in the northern part of the Corridor.

**Materials and methods**

We collected blood samples from 10 Tibetan and 10 Han Chinese individuals from Gansu province and genotyped about 600,000 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).

**Results**

Our data revealed that the populations in the Corridor are all admixed on a genetic cline of deriving ancestry from Tibetans on the Plateau and surrounding lowland East Asians. The Tibetan and Han Chinese groups in the north of the Plateau show significant evidence of low-level West Eurasian admixture that could be probably traced back to 600∼900 years ago.

**Discussion**

We conclude that there have been huge population migrations from surrounding lowland onto the Tibetan Plateau via the Tibetan-Yi Corridor since the initial formation of Tibetans probably in Neolithic Time, which leads to the current genetic structure of Tibeto-Burman speaking populations.","Sino-Tibetan, population genetics, Tibetan, "

Diplodocidae are among the best known sauropod dinosaurs. Several species were described in the late 1800s or early 1900s from the Morrison Formation of North America. Since then, numerous additional specimens were recovered in the USA, Tanzania, Portugal, and Argentina, as well as possibly Spain, England, Georgia, Zimbabwe, and Asia. To date, the clade includes about 12 to 15 nominal species, some of them with questionable taxonomic status (e.g., ‘Diplodocus’ hayi or Dyslocosaurus polyonychius), and ranging in age from Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous. However, intrageneric relationships of the iconic, multi-species genera Apatosaurus and Diplodocus are still poorly known. The way to resolve this issue is a specimen-based phylogenetic analysis, which has been previously implemented for Apatosaurus, but is here performed for the first time for the entire clade of Diplodocidae.

The analysis includes 81 operational taxonomic units, 49 of which belong to Diplodocidae. The set of OTUs includes all name-bearing type specimens previously proposed to belong to Diplodocidae, alongside a set of relatively complete referred specimens, which increase the amount of anatomically overlapping material. Non-diplodocid outgroups were selected to test the affinities of potential diplodocid specimens that have subsequently been suggested to belong outside the clade. The specimens were scored for 477 morphological characters, representing one of the most extensive phylogenetic analyses of sauropod dinosaurs. Character states were figured and tables given in the case of numerical characters.

The resulting cladogram recovers the classical arrangement of diplodocid relationships. Two numerical approaches were used to increase reproducibility in our taxonomic delimitation of species and genera. This resulted in the proposal that some species previously included in well-known genera like Apatosaurus and Diplodocus are generically distinct. Of particular note is that the famous genus Brontosaurus is considered valid by our quantitative approach. Furthermore, “Diplodocus” hayi represents a unique genus, which will herein be called Galeamopus gen. nov. On the other hand, these numerical approaches imply synonymization of “Dinheirosaurus” from the Late Jurassic of Portugal with the Morrison Formation genus Supersaurus. Our use of a specimen-, rather than species-based approach increases knowledge of intraspecific and intrageneric variation in diplodocids, and the study demonstrates how specimen-based phylogenetic analysis is a valuable tool in sauropod taxonomy, and potentially in paleontology and taxonomy as a whole.

Theories of communication predict a relationship between length and meaning, however: Longer descriptions should be more conceptually complex. Here we show that both the lexicons of human languages and individual speakers encode the relationship between linguistic and conceptual complexity. Experimentally, participants mapped longer words to more complex objects in comprehension and production tasks and across a range of stimuli. Explicit judgments of conceptual complexity were also highly correlated with implicit measures of study time in a memory task, suggesting that complexity is directly related to basic cognitive processes. Observationally, judgments of conceptual complexity for a sample of real words correlate highly with their length across 80 languages, even controlling for frequency, familiarity, imageability, and concreteness. While word lengths are systematically related to usage-both frequency and contextual predictability-our results reveal a systematic relationship with meaning as well. They point to a general regularity in the design of lexicons and suggest that pragmatic pressures may influence the structure of the lexicon.","speech norms, complexity, psycholinguistics, word length, "

Trips2017,"The word shrimpburger is a primary example of reanalysis within the word. Reanalysis is a development that alters the structure of a form because this structure is or becomes ambiguous. In our case, the basis of the reanalysis was the word hamburger, which originally denotes a person from the city of Hamburg. But at the beginning of the 20th century in the United States a type of food called Hamburger steak became popular, which was often shortened to hamburger. According to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), burger is a terminal element denoting a roll or a sandwich that contains the foodstuff specified in the first element. So evidently at some point in time (or more precisely in the 1940s in the United States as stated by the OED), speakers reanalyzed the structure of [hamburger] as the new structure [ham][burger], which then made way for many new formations, for example, krautburger, kosherburger, soyburger, veggieburger, beefburger, (bacon-)cheeseburger (all found in the Corpus of Contemporary American English, COCA), and shrimpburger from the example above. What the reanalysis of hamburger shows is that this change on the level of word structure was triggered by a new semantic analysis of innovative speakers, so morphology and semantics interacted and brought about the change.","reanalysis, morphology, hamburger, "

Some linguists (especially in the generative tradition) assume that linguistic categories are

Varasdi2017,"The semantics of progressive sentences presents a challenge to linguists and philosophers alike. According to a widely accepted view, the truth-conditions of progressive sentences rely essentially on a notion of inertia. Dowty (Word meaning and Montague grammar: the semantics of verbs and times in generative grammar and in Montague’s PTQ, D. Reidel Publishing Company, Dordrecht, 1979) suggested inertia worlds to implement this “inertia idea” in a formal semantic theory of the progressive. The main thesis of the paper is that the notion of inertia went through a subtle, but crucial change when worlds were replaced by events in Landman (Nat Lang Semant 1:1–32, 1992) and Portner (Language 74(4):760–787, 1998), and that this new, event-related concept of inertia results in a possibility-based theory of the progressive. An important case in point in the paper is a proof that, despite its surface structure, the theory presented in Portner (1998) does not implement the notion of inertia in Dowty (1979); rather, it belongs together with Dowty’s earlier, 1977 theory according to which the progressive is a possibility operator.","inertia, semantics, logic, truth value"

clear-cut truth-conditions, progressive sentences are infamous to have remarkably
elastic truth-conditions over and above the usual vagueness pervading language. 1 The
reason for this appears to be connected with the fact that progressive sentences classify
a spatiotemporal segment of the world in terms of the complete events into which that
segment might develop under certain conditions. This gives rise to a kind of double
uncertainty: uncertainty with respect to what to include in the spatiotemporal segment
being described, and uncertainty with respect to the event properties used in classifying
it. Since these two parameters are clearly not independent of each other, identifying
the truth-conditions of a progressive sentence is often very difficult.","English, progressive, semantics, logic, truth value"

phonological awareness, and in particular phonemic awareness, is the strongest

many of the measures used to assess sub-skills such as phonemic awareness are oral

this limitation, we developed and administered two receptive measures of phonemic

Abdaoui2017,"Sentiment analysis allows the semantic evaluation of pieces of text

has been given to the polarity (positive, negative) of English words, only few studies
were interested in the conveyed emotions (joy, anger, surprise, sadness, etc.)
especially in other languages. In this paper, we present the elaboration and the
evaluation of a new French lexicon considering both polarity and emotion. The
elaboration method is based on the semi-automatic translation and expansion to
synonyms of the English NRC Word Emotion Association Lexicon (NRC-Emo-
Lex). First, online translators have been automatically queried in order to create a
first version of our new French Expanded Emotion Lexicon (FEEL). Then, a human
professional translator manually validated the automatically obtained entries and the
associated emotions. She agreed with more than 94 % of the pre-validated entries
(those found by a majority of translators) and less than 18 % of the remaining
entries (those found by very few translators). This result highlights that online tools
can be used to get high quality resources with low cost. Annotating a subset of terms
by three different annotators shows that the associated sentiments and emotions are
consistent. Finally, extensive experiments have been conducted to compare the final version of FEEL with other existing French lexicons. Various French benchmarks
for polarity and emotion classifications have been used in these evaluations.
Experiments have shown that FEEL obtains competitive results for polarity, and
significantly better results for basic emotions.","word emotions, emotion concepts, corpus, concept list, dataset, "

human experience into a system of semantic categories, labeled by words or mor-

same universally shared set of categories – instead, both the labels and the categories

Wilson2004,"A common problem for linguists, philosophers and psychologists is that linguistically specified ('literal') word meanings are often modified in use. The literal meaning may be narrowed (e.g. drink used to mean 'alcoholic drink'), approximated (e.g. square used to mean 'squarish') or undergo metaphorical extension (e.g. rose or diamond applied to a person). Typically, narrowing, approximation and metaphorical extension are seen as distinct pragmatic processes with no common explanation: thus, narrowing has been analysed in terms of default rules (e.g. Levinson 2000), approximation has been treated as a type of pragmatic vagueness (e.g. Lewis 1983; Lasersohn 1999) and metaphorical extension is standardly seen as a case of maxim violation with resulting implicature (Grice 1989). I will propose a unified account on which narrowing, approximation and metaphorical extension are special cases of a more general pragmatic adjustment process which applies spontaneously, automatically and unconsciously to fine-tune the interpretation of virtually every word, and show how the notion of an ad hoc concept introduced by Barsalou (1987, 1992) might interact with a pragmatic comprehension procedure developed in relevance theory (Sperber & Wilson 1998; Carston 2002; Wilson & Sperber 2002) to account for a wide range of examples.","semantics, pragmatics, communication, language-use"

According to Gould, the root cause of these oversights was confirmation bias by psychometricians, an unwarranted commitment to the idea that intelligence was a fixed, immutable quality of people. By virtue of a similar, systemic interpretive bias, in the last two decades, numerous contemporary researchers in comparative psychology have claimed human superiority over apes in social intelligence, based on two-group comparisons between postindustrial, Western Europeans and captive apes, where the apes have been isolated from European styles of social interaction, and tested with radically different procedures. Moreover, direct comparisons of humans with apes suffer from pervasive lapses in argumentation: Research designs in wide contemporary use are inherently mute about the underlying psychological causes of overt behavior.

In the case of microorganisms, decreasing sequencing costs have enabled researchers to generate ever-larger sequence datasets, which in turn have begun to fill gaps in the evolutionary history of microbial groups. However, phylogenetic analyses of large sequence datasets present challenges to extracting meaningful trends from complex trees. Scientific inferences made by visual inspection of phylogenetic trees can be simplified and enhanced by customizing various parts of the tree, including label color, branch color, and other features. Yet, manual customization is time-consuming and error prone, and programs designed to assist in batch tree customization often require programming experience. To address these limitations, we developed Iroki, a program for fast, automatic customization of phylogenetic trees. Iroki allows the user to incorporate information on a broad range of metadata for each experimental unit represented in the tree. Results Iroki was applied to four existing microbial sequence datasets to demonstrate its utility in data exploration and presentation. Specifically, we used Iroki to highlight connections between viral phylogeny and host taxonomy, explore the abundance of microbial groups associated with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) in cattle, examine short-term temporal dynamics of virioplankton communities, and to search for trends in the biogeography of Zetaproteobacteria. Conclusions Iroki is an easy-to-use application having both command line and web-browser implementations for fast, automatic customization of phylogenetic trees based on user-provided categorical or continuous metadata. Iroki enables hypothesis testing through improved visualization of phylogenetic trees, streamlining the process of biological sequence data exploration and presentation.

Using the largest multi-locus data set known to date, we investigated genetic differentiation of early modern humans, human admixture and migration events, and relationships among ancestries and language groups. We compiled publicly available genome-wide genotype data on 5,966 individuals from 282 global samples, representing 30 primary language families. The best evidence supports 21 ancestries that delineate genetic structure of present-day human populations. Independent of self-identified ethno-linguistic labels, the vast majority (97.3%) of individuals have mixed ancestry, with evidence of multiple ancestries in 96.8% of samples and on all continents. The data indicate that continents, ethno-linguistic groups, races, ethnicities, and individuals all show substantial ancestral heterogeneity. We estimated correlation coefficients ranging from 0.522 to 0.962 between ancestries and language families or branches. Ancestry data support the grouping of Kwadi-Khoe, Kx’a, and Tuu languages, support the exclusion of Omotic languages from the Afroasiatic language family, and do not support the proposed Dené-Yeniseian language family as a genetically valid grouping.

dominant and broader functions (Cooper, 1989, pp. 99�121; Kaplan & Baldauf,
1997, p. 31; Spolsky & Shohamy, 1999, p. 39). Depending on the motivating social
concerns, status planning may or may not make any overt policy statement about the
fate or status of the competing languages/dialects when the selection is made. For
example, while selecting Hebrew as the official language, status planning in Israel
treats Arabic as a statutory language, recognizing the linguistic and ethnic
distinctiveness of the Arabic (see Cooper, 1989, pp. 100�101; Spolsky & Shohamy,
1999). On the other hand, designating English as the only official language,
California's 1986 and 1998 propositions denied the legitimacy of the use of non-
English languages in governmental and educational domains, attempting to force
minority groups to assimilate into the English-speaking majority (cf. Crawford,
2000, pp. 104-127; Cooper, 1989, pp. 101-102). Thus, it is enlightening for students
of language policy to study the relationship between the selected language/dialect
and the once-competing ones.

automatic tone analysis approach is proposed. SOM is facilitated to map the F0

Our version of DB-Index assumes that characters that have similar tones in the

Modern Chinese dialects field-work was originated in the early 20th century and
further developed by the founder of Chinese Dialectology--Yuenren Chao. The
requirement of the investigators (field-workers) is that they must investigate and
record the dialects of the informants face to face, strictly according to the facts.
This method is generally classified into three steps:
Step one: Preparation stage. Determine the specific purpose and task of the dialect
investigation, formulate the outline, make survey forms, and prepare the necessary

Kays2011,"With the human population in many areas of the world already above the carrying capacity of the land,
food availability and advances in productivity are becoming increasingly critical. It is predicted that
the world population will reach 9 billion people by 2050, which represents a dramatic increase in the
number of people to feed, with increasingly scarce crop land, water, fertilizer, and fuel. Vegetables
make up a major portion of the diet of humans, providing not only calories but essential vitamins,
fiber, and minerals and will play an increasingly important role in food availability. Of the over 400
vegetable crops that are grown commercially, the genetic diversity in critical attributes is exceptional.
The edible portion of vegetables is comprised of an array of morphological parts [e.g. leaves, stems,
lateral buds, young plants, shoots, petioles, flowers, flower buds, fruit (immature to mature), seeds,
seedlings, roots, tubers, corms, bulbs, rhizomes]. Vegetables vary widely in the length of time required
from planting to harvest, postharvest longevity, and day length, temperature, water, fertility, and
pesticide requirements. They provide a diverse range of tastes, aromas, textures, colors, and nutritional
attributes, greatly increasing the variety in the foods we eat and satisfying a myriad of personal
preferences. The length of time required to produce a crop (i.e. planting to harvest) varies from days to
several years and the length of optimum harvest maturity from hours (gerkins � Cucumis sativus L.) to
years (giant taro � Alocasia macrorrhiza (L.) Schott). The fact that short production cycle vegetables
allow multiple cropping and a significant volume of the vegetables grown worldwide are produced
on small plots, militates against accurate production statistics, preventing a clear understanding and
appreciation of the value of these crops to the world food supply.

Kirby2007,"Human language arises from biological evolution, individual learn-

processes has not been widely studied. We set out a formal
framework for analyzing cultural transmission, which allows us to
investigate how innate learning biases are related to universal
properties of language. We show that cultural transmission can
magnify weak biases into strong linguistic universals, undermining
one of the arguments for strong innate constraints on language
learning. As a consequence, the strength of innate biases can be
shielded from natural selection, allowing these genes to drift.
Furthermore, even when there is no natural selection, cultural
transmission can produce apparent adaptations. Cultural transmis-

Liang2015,"The perception and definition of a linguistic variety as a ""language"" or a ""dialect""
can be an ideological issue at the societal level and an attitudinal decision for each
individual. If there is any consensus among linguists on the distinction between
""language"" and ""dialect"", it would be that a clear-cut distinction is largely unattain-
able. In a descriptive, synchronic sense, a language may refer to a group of related
linguistic norms or a single norm, and a dialect is presumably one of the norms
(Haugen 1966). Hence every dialect is a language, but not every language is a dia-
lect. Language as a generalised notion means that every speaker of a language is a
speaker of at least one dialect (Chambers and Trudgill 2004)--standard English is,
for example ""just as much a dialect as any other form of English"" (p. 3). The gen-
eralised and specific dual sense of the term ""language"" in its synchronic dimension
adds to the muddle of the issue, and thus scholars have proposed the term ""variety""
to be used instead as a descriptive label for a single linguistic entity in a ""neutral""
and ad hoc manner. While this is methodologically convenient, the superordinate�
subordinate model of the language�dialect relationship cannot avoid the question of
genetic relationship. How closely related would a group of linguistic norms need to
be considered as dialects of the same language? When would these norms be con-
sidered separate languages? To what extent does mutual intelligibility play a role in
determining answers to these two questions?

Muthukrishna2016,"Innovation is often assumed to be the work of a talented few, whose pro-
ducts are passed on to the masses. Here, we argue that innovations are
instead an emergent property of our species' cultural learning abilities,
applied within our societies and social networks. Our societies and social
networks act as collective brains. We outline how many human brains,
which evolved primarily for the acquisition of culture, together beget a col-
lective brain. Within these collective brains, the three main sources of
innovation are serendipity, recombination and incremental improvement.
We argue that rates of innovation are heavily influenced by (i) sociality,
(ii) transmission fidelity, and (iii) cultural variance. We discuss some of
the forces that affect these factors. These factors can also shape each other.
For example, we provide preliminary evidence that transmission efficiency
is affected by sociality--languages with more speakers are more efficient.
We argue that collective brains can make each of their constituent cultural
brains more innovative. This perspective sheds light on traits, such as IQ,
that have been implicated in innovation. A collective brain perspective can
help us understand otherwise puzzling findings in the IQ literature, includ-

of social cognition of dogs have been affected by domestication and ontogeny. To address the effects
of domestication, we compared captive wolves (n=12) and dogs (n=14) living in packs under the same
conditions. To explore developmental effects, we compared these dogs to pet dogs (n=12) living in
human families. The animals were faced with a series of object-choice tasks, in which their response to
communicative, behavioural and causal cues was tested. We observed that wolves outperformed dogs
in their ability to follow causal cues, suggesting that domestication altered specific skills relating to
this domain, whereas developmental effects had surprisingly no influence. All three groups performed
similarly in the communicative and behavioural conditions, suggesting higher ontogenetic flexibility in
the two social domains. These differences across cognitive domains need to be further investigated, by
comparing domestic and non-domesticated animals living in varying conditions.

results of the World Color Survey (WCS) of 110 languages to show
that despite gross differences across languages, communication of
chromatic chips is always better for warm colors (yellows/reds) than
cool colors (blues/greens). We present an analysis of color statistics in
a large databank of natural images curated by human observers for
salient objects and show that objects tend to have warm rather than
cool colors. These results suggest that the cross-linguistic similarity in
color-naming efficiency reflects colors of universal usefulness and
provide an account of a principle (color use) that governs how color
categories come about. We show that potential methodological
issues with the WCS do not corrupt information-theoretic analyses,
by collecting original data using two extreme versions of the color-
naming task, in three groups: the Tsimane’, a remote Amazonian
hunter-gatherer isolate; Bolivian-Spanish speakers; and English
speakers. These data also enabled us to test another prediction
of the color-usefulness hypothesis: that differences in color cat-
egorization between languages are caused by differences in
overall usefulness of color to a culture. In support, we found that
color naming among Tsimane’ had relatively low communicative
efficiency, and the Tsimane’ were less likely to use color terms
when describing familiar objects. Color-naming among Tsimane’
was boosted when naming artificially colored objects compared
with natural objects, suggesting that industrialization promotes
color usefulness.","color terms, warm colors, cool colors, psycholinguistics, "

systems as if they were more successful or less successful attempts to approximate
the Roman alphabet, seen as the only possible ideal from which any other kind of
script could only be viewed as a falling-off. In 1960, for instance, the distinguished
anthropologist Sir Jack Goody and the literary critic Ian Watt co-authored a widely-

mean societies using an alphabetic script, as opposed to societies like China which
for over three millennia has (as Goody and Watt saw it) been struggling with a
system of writing too crude to confer the benefits of literacy on the society which
uses it. Michael & Jennifer Cole (2006: 305) note that Goody and Watt’s paper, and

extant, there is no guarantee that in other, comparable cases we could find
orthographies which make it clear that some apparent generalization about
writing systems was spurious. A generalization which turned out to hold for

article is concerned with the delineation of features that are important in natural language concepts and the use
of these features in the study of semantic concept representation. The results of a feature generation task in which
the exemplars and labels of 15 semantic categories served as cues are described. The importance of the generated
features was assessed by tallying the frequency with which they were generated and by obtaining judgments of
their relevance. The generated attributes also featured in extensive exemplar by feature applicability matrices

This study is based on a triangulation where taste terms and their use is investigated in a fairly

the study is to explore how universal words for sweet are positively and words for bitter are negatively
connotated in individual languages such as Swedish and more generally in the world's languages. This
is done by looking into polysemic relations, colexification patterns and metaphors across languages.
The result shows that general trends are the same from the triangulation's two studies, but that there

Serzant2015,"The paper is primarily devoted to a methodological discussion. There are two
different types of inquiries into diachronic syntax and, more generally, grammar:
stage reconstruction and etymological reconstruction. The aim of the first type
is to reconstruct and compare diachronic stages within a particular functional
domain, while the second type focuses on the etymology or the origin of a
particular grammatical category. It is the second type of inquiry that is the topic
of this paper. I argue for a methodology based on the Historical-Comparative
Method that should ensure a higher degree of reconstructional probability and
exclude factors other than inheritance that might also be potentially responsible
for correlations across related languages. On this approach, the construction
under investigation must be individualized against its respective typological
background: creating lists of morphological, lexical (input), syntactic and
semantic properties – a procedure that I refer to as profiling (notion borrowed
from Cognitive Linguistics). The general principle here is that correlations
of typologically quirky properties increase the degree of probability of any
reconstruction. An obvious typological quirk is the morphological profile of a
construction, since the phonetic realization of morphological markers and their
combinations is purely accidental and is not subject to typological universals.
The morphological inventory of the construction must be reconstructible in the
proto-language on the basis of the Historical-Comparative Method. The ability
to reconstruct the morphological inventory also excludes language contact as a
potential source for correlations. Other typologically idiosyncratic properties – if
reconstructible – may also increase the degree of reconstruction probability. To
illustrate how this method may be applied, I focus on the development of the
independent partitive genitive from Proto-Indo-European into Baltic and Russian
and, finally, into North Russian dialects. On the basis of this method I show that
this category is inherited from Proto-Indo-European. I examine the syntactic
profiles of this category at different stages and account for changes.","syntactic reconstruction, comparative method, onomasiological approach, onomasiological reconstruction, "

Ding2017,"This paper argues that a linguistic or any other type of sign should not be viewed as a static unit in a synchronic system, but rather as a dynamic entity that appears in real communicative events. As discrete entries in a dictionary, words are given definitions as their meanings, but these definitions may lead to interpretations that have not been sanctioned by a language community and yet are totally reasonable and understandable. In this way, “old” words can be used to stand for “new” segments of our life experience through which some meanings are born and others modified.

We summarize several findings from recent studies in neuroscience and the cognitive sciences suggesting that emotion, body, and language are three factors required for understanding the emergence of abstract words, and (1) propose a model explaining how these factors contribute to the emergence of connotations, (2) formulate a computational model instantiating our theoretical model, and (3) test our model in a task involving the automatic identification of connotations.

relative of the Tsez (Dido) language, and some previously proposed formal classifications based on lexical data appear to confirm this.
However, the new and advanced lexicostatistical classification used in this paper suggests that Hinukh and Tsez do not in fact form a
distinct clade. We examine Hinukh and Tsez historical phonology as well as morphological and syntactic features, upon which the
traditional expert classifications have rested, and find that all exclusive traits seemingly shared by Hinukh and Tsez are either illusory or
due to contact-driven parallel development or may simply represent Proto-Tsezic retentions. In other words, there is no phonological and
grammatical evidence for a hypothetical Tsez-Hinukh protolanguage. On the contrary, there are some exclusive grammatical features of
the Tsez and Khwarshi languages that may be regarded as innovations of a Tsez-Khwarshi protolanguage, conforming with a distinct
Tsez-Khwarshi node in the new lexicostatistical classification of Tsezic. Therefore the traditional criterion of shared innovations supports
the validity of the modern version of the lexicostatistical method employed in this paper.","shared innovation, methodology, parallel development, subgrouping"

We used deep neural networks to extract features from 35,326 facial images. These features were entered into a logistic regression aimed at classifying sexual orientation. Given a single facial image, a classifier could correctly distinguish between gay and heterosexual men in 81% of cases, and in 74% of cases for women. Human judges achieved much lower accuracy: 61% for men and 54% for women. The accuracy of the algorithm increased to 91% and 83%, respectively, given five facial images per person. Facial features employed by the classifier included both fixed (e.g., nose shape) and transient facial features (e.g., grooming style). Consistent with the prenatal hormone theory of sexual orientation, gay men and women tended to have gender-atypical facial morphology, expression, and grooming styles. Prediction models aimed at gender alone allowed for detecting gay males with 57% accuracy and gay females with 58% accuracy. Those findings advance our understanding of the origins of sexual orientation and the limits of human perception. Additionally, given that companies and governments are increasingly using computer vision algorithms to detect people’s intimate traits, our findings expose a threat to the privacy and safety of gay men and women.","machine learning, neural network, sexual orientation, "

Frost2012,"In the last decade, reading research has seen a paradigmatic shift. A new wave of computational models of orthographic
processing that offer various forms of noisy position or context-sensitive coding have revolutionized the field of visual word
recognition. The influx of such models stems mainly from consistent findings, coming mostly from European languages, regarding an
apparent insensitivity of skilled readers to letter order. Underlying the current revolution is the theoretical assumption that the
insensitivity of readers to letter order reflects the special way in which the human brain encodes the position of letters in printed
words. The present article discusses the theoretical shortcomings and misconceptions of this approach to visual word recognition. A
systematic review of data obtained from a variety of languages demonstrates that letter-order insensitivity is neither a general
property of the cognitive system nor a property of the brain in encoding letters. Rather, it is a variant and idiosyncratic characteristic
of some languages, mostly European, reflecting a strategy of optimizing encoding resources, given the specific structure of words.
Since the main goal of reading research is to develop theories that describe the fundamental and invariant phenomena of reading
across orthographies, an alternative approach to model visual word recognition is offered. The dimensions of a possible universal
model of reading, which outlines the common cognitive operations involved in orthographic processing in all writing systems, are
discussed.","reading, writing systems, Chinese writing system, modelling, cross-linguistic study"

subsystem by simplicity elsewhere. In this paper evidence against this idea is presented by
examining several subsystems of the basic phonology in a set of over 600 languages selected to
represent genetic and areal diversity. The relationships between elaboration of the syllable canon,
the size of segment inventories and the complexity of tone systems are studied. The languages are
grouped into three syllable complexity classes. The ‘simple’ class permits only (C)V patterns.
‘Moderate’ languages allow CC onsets with common structures (those with an approximant or
‘liquid’ as C2) and/or permit a single coda consonant. ‘Complex’ languages allow more elaborate
clusters. Languages are also divided into three tonal groupings, those with no tone contrasts, those
with simple tone systems (two levels) and those with more elaborate tone systems. Consonant, total
vowel and vowel quality inventories are numeric values. There is a significant positive correlation
between the complexity of syllable type and size of consonant inventory, but no correlation between
syllable complexity and size of total vowel or vowel quality inventories. Consonant and vowel
inventory sizes show no correlation with each other. Complex syllable structure shows some
association with absence of tone, but none of the other comparisons show that complexity is
systematically compensated for by simplicity elsewhere.","tone language, cross-linguistic study, phoneme inventory, "

Emeny2017,"Epigenetic regulation in anxiety is suggested, but evidence from large studies is needed. We conducted an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) on anxiety in a population-based cohort and validated our finding in a clinical cohort as well as a murine model. In the KORA cohort, participants (n=1522, age 32–72 years) were administered the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) instrument, whole blood DNA methylation was measured (Illumina 450K BeadChip), and circulating levels of hs-CRP and IL-18 were assessed in the association between anxiety and methylation. DNA methylation was measured using the same instrument in a study of patients with anxiety disorders recruited at the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry (MPIP, 131 non-medicated cases and 169 controls). To expand our mechanistic understanding, these findings were reverse translated in a mouse model of acute social defeat stress. In the KORA study, participants were classified according to mild, moderate, or severe levels of anxiety (29.4%/6.0%/1.5%, respectively). Severe anxiety was associated with 48.5% increased methylation at a single CpG site (cg12701571) located in the promoter of the gene encoding Asb1 (β-coefficient=0.56 standard error (SE)=0.10, p (Bonferroni)=0.005), a protein hypothetically involved in regulation of cytokine signaling. An interaction between IL-18 and severe anxiety with methylation of this CpG cite showed a tendency towards significance in the total population (p=0.083) and a significant interaction among women (p=0.014). Methylation of the same CpG was positively associated with Panic and Agoraphobia scale (PAS) scores (β=0.005, SE=0.002, p=0.021, n=131) among cases in the MPIP study. In a murine model of acute social defeat stress, Asb1 gene expression was significantly upregulated in a tissue-specific manner (p=0.006), which correlated with upregulation of the neuroimmunomodulating cytokine interleukin 1 beta. Our findings suggest epigenetic regulation of the stress-responsive Asb1 gene in anxiety-related phenotypes. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the causal direction of this association and the potential role of Asb1-mediated immune dysregulation in anxiety disorders.","anxiety, epigenetics, inheritance, biology, biological evolution"
Fristoe2017,"The cognitive buffer hypothesis posits that environmental variability can be a major driver of the evolution of cognition because an enhanced ability to produce flexible behavioural responses facilitates coping with the unexpected. Although comparative evidence supports different aspects of this hypothesis, a direct connection between cognition and the ability to survive a variable and unpredictable environment has yet to be demonstrated. Here, we use complementary demographic and evolutionary analyses to show that among birds, the mechanistic premise of this hypothesis is well supported but the implied direction of causality is not. Specifically, we show that although population dynamics are more stable and less affected by environmental variation in birds with larger relative brain sizes, the evolution of larger brains often pre-dated and facilitated the colonization of variable habitats rather than the other way around. Our findings highlight the importance of investigating the timeline of evolutionary events when interpreting patterns of phylogenetic correlation.","bird evolution, brain size, habitat, colonization, "

studies of animal vocalizations, this research has focused mainly on the emotional inter-

types, and the mapping between acoustic and emotional categories, thus remain under-
explored. In a cross-linguistic naming task (Experiment 1), verbal categorization of 132
authentic (non-acted) human vocalizations by English-, Swedish- and Russian-speaking
participants revealed the same major acoustic types: laugh, cry, scream, moan, and pos-
sibly roar and sigh. The association between call type and perceived emotion was sys-
tematic but non-redundant: listeners associated every call type with a limited, but in some
cases relatively wide, range of emotions. The speed and consistency of naming the call
type predicted the speed and consistency of inferring the caller’s emotion, suggesting that
acoustic and emotional categorizations are closely related. However, participants preferred
to name the call type before naming the emotion. Furthermore, nonverbal categorization of
the same stimuli in a triad classification task (Experiment 2) was more compatible with
classification by call type than by emotion, indicating the former’s greater perceptual
salience. These results suggest that acoustic categorization may precede attribution of
emotion, highlighting the need to distinguish between the overt form of nonverbal signals

Wilkins2017,"**Ancient Weaponry**

Hafting, which allowed projectile points to be attached to a staff, was an important technological advance that greatly increased the functionality of weapons of early humans. This technology was used by both Neandertals and early Homo sapiens and is readily seen after about 200,000 to 300,000 years ago, but whether it was used by a common ancestor or was separately acquired by each species is unclear. Supporting use by a common ancestor, Wilkins et al. (p. 942) report that stone points in a site in central South Africa were hafted to form spears around 500,000 years ago. The evidence includes damaged edges consistent with this use and marks at the base that are suggestive of hafting.

**Abstract**

Hafting stone points to spears was an important advance in weaponry for early humans. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that ~500,000-year-old stone points from the archaeological site of Kathu Pan 1 (KP1), South Africa, functioned as spear tips. KP1 points exhibit fracture types diagnostic of impact. Modification near the base of some points is consistent with hafting. Experimental and metric data indicate that the points could function well as spear tips. Shape analysis demonstrates that the smaller retouched points are as symmetrical as larger retouched points, which fits expectations for spear tips. The distribution of edge damage is similar to that in an experimental sample of spear tips and is inconsistent with expectations for cutting or scraping tools. Thus, early humans were manufacturing hafted multicomponent tools ~200,000 years earlier than previously thought.","spear technology, early humans, hominid evolution, language evolution, origin of language"

Bomfleur2017,"The Osmundales (Royal Fern order) originated in the late Paleozoic and is the most ancient surviving lineage of leptosporangiate ferns. In contrast to its low diversity today (less than 20 species in six genera), it has the richest fossil record of any extant group of ferns. The structurally preserved trunks and rhizomes alone are referable to more than 100 fossil species that are classified in up to 20 genera, four subfamilies, and two families. This diverse fossil record constitutes an exceptional source of information on the evolutionary history of the group from the Permian to the present. However, inconsistent terminology, varying formats of description, and the general lack of a uniform taxonomic concept renders this wealth of information poorly accessible. To this end, we provide a comprehensive review of the diversity of structural features of osmundalean axes under a standardized, descriptive terminology. A novel morphological character matrix with 45 anatomical characters scored for 15 extant species and for 114 fossil operational units (species or specimens) is analysed using networks in order to establish systematic relationships among fossil and extant Osmundales rooted in axis anatomy. The results lead us to propose an evolutionary classification for fossil Osmundales and a revised, standardized taxonomy for all taxa down to the rank of (sub)genus. We introduce several nomenclatural novelties: (1) a new subfamily Itopsidemoideae (Guaireaceae) is established to contain Itopsidema, Donwelliacaulis, and Tiania; (2) the thamnopteroid genera Zalesskya, Iegosigopteris, and Petcheropteris are all considered synonymous with Thamnopteris; (3) 12 species of Millerocaulis and Ashicaulis are assigned to modern genera (tribe Osmundeae); (4) the hitherto enigmatic Aurealcaulis is identified as an extinct subgenus of Plenasium; and (5) the poorly known Osmundites tuhajkulensis is assigned to Millerocaulis. In addition, we consider Millerocaulis stipabonettiorum a possible member of Palaeosmunda and Millerocaulis estipularis as probably constituting the earliest representative of the (Todea-)Leptopteris lineage (subtribe Todeinae) of modern Osmundoideae.","morphological characters, maximum parsimony, phylogenetic network, "

6,000–10,000 y, there are suggestions that grammatical structures
might retain more signal over time than other subsystems, such as
basic vocabulary. In this study, we use a Dirichlet process mixture

from 81 Austronesian languages. We show that, on average, most

derivational affixes. While some linguists (Marantz 1997, 2001; Marvin 2003) con-
sider derivational affixes a type of functional morpheme that realizes a categorial
head, others (Lowenstamm 2015; De Belder 2011) argue that derivational affixes are
roots. Our proposal, which finds its empirical basis in a study of Dutch derivational
affixes, takes a middle position. We argue that there are two types of derivational
affixes: some that are roots (i.e. lexical morphemes) and others that are categorial
heads (i.e. functional morphemes). Affixes that are roots show ‘flexible’ categorial
behavior, are subject to ‘lexical’ phonological rules, and may trigger idiosyncratic
meanings. Affixes that realize categorial heads, on the other hand, are categorially
rigid, do not trigger ‘lexical’ phonological rules nor allow for idiosyncrasies in their
interpretation.","introduction, phylogenetic reconstruction, language evolution, family tree"

conceptual tools, where analogies are drawn between hypotheses, patterns or pro-

the data in one field is adapted to be applied to the data of the other; and (3)
analytical tools, where common problems encountered in both fields can be solved
using useful tricks developed by one or the other. I will argue that conceptual tools
borrowed from linguistics contributed to the Darwinian revolution in biology; that
theoretical tools of evolutionary change can in some cases be applied to both genetic

example, one and the same language may be referred to as Persian or Farsi. This
short paper discusses some principles that one might use for making decisions
when there are variant forms in use, or when one feels that none of the existing
names is appropriate. The principles discussed here arose from work on Glottolog,
an English-language database of the world’s languages (Glottolog.org), where
each language has a single primary English name (though variant forms are of
course included), and where the goal is to choose the best variant form as the
primary name of the language. Whenever the question arises which variant name
form to choose, the Glottolog editors are guided by these principles, so they are
formulated in a prescriptive way, but with explanation and justification for each
principle. It seems that the general issue is also quite important for language docu-

staples of typology – with the “how” (diachronic typology) and, less familiarly
for typologists, the “why”, in the form of explanations that should ultimately
account not only for how each point in the design space has arisen, but also for
what is common, what is rare, what typological traits go together or not, and –
more controversially – what types of extralinguistic setting they are found in.","extra-linguistic factors, universals, diachronic explanations"

Dediu2007,"The correlations between interpopulation genetic and linguistic diversities are mostly noncausal (spurious), being due to historical processes and geographical factors that shape them in similar ways. Studies of such correlations usually consider allele frequencies and linguistic groupings (dialects, languages, linguistic families or phyla), sometimes controlling for geographic, topographic, or ecological factors. Here, we consider the relation between allele frequencies and linguistic typological features. Specifically, we focus on the derived haplogroups of the brain growth and development-related genes ASPM and Microcephalin, which show signs of natural selection and a marked geographic structure, and on linguistic tone, the use of voice pitch to convey lexical or grammatical distinctions. We hypothesize that there is a relationship between the population frequency of these two alleles and the presence of linguistic tone and test this hypothesis relative to a large database (983 alleles and 26 linguistic features in 49 populations), showing that it is not due to the usual explanatory factors represented by geography and history. The relationship between genetic and linguistic diversity in this case may be causal: certain alleles can bias language acquisition or processing and thereby influence the trajectory of language change through iterated cultural transmission.

sound change. From then until now, new cases have continued to come to light. A close look at the
development of intervocalic -s- in Greek, reveals the divergent approach of the two schools of thought.
All examples of grammatical conditioning are amenable to explanation as some combination of regular
sound change, analogy, or borrowing. Neither the Neogrammarian belief in exceptionless phonetically
conditioned sound change nor the generative inspired belief in grammatical conditioning is a falsifiable

Lee2017,"Can the language we speak determine how we represent the world around us? To those familiar with
the theory of linguistic relativity, this may seem like an age-old question about which everyone has
their own answer. Although the evidence supporting linguistic relativity remains controversial, the
long reach of language into our perception and behavior is nevertheless an intriguing possibility
that deserves further investigation. Here I take a closer look at a case of linguistic relativity that had a
particularly strong impact on cross-cultural research: the pronoun-drop effect. The theory of pronoun-drop effect posits that languages that allow their speakers to drop subject pronouns in verbal communication would lead their speakers to create collectivistic culture. It was argued that the absence of
pronouns necessitates the speakers to embed their self-identities in the context of social interaction,
so the linguistic practice of omitting pronouns would reduce the sense of individuality in the minds of
speakers. After conducting a series of Bayesian multilevel analyses on the original dataset, however,
the current study concludes that the pronoun-drop effect is unlikely to be a robust, universal phenomenon. The analyses revealed that the majority of statistical signal supporting the phenomenon comes
from the Indo-European language family, and other families provided little or inconsistent evidence. It
was also observed that the Indo-European languages alone made up 61 per cent of the original data-
set, and dropping them from analysis completely nullified the pronoun-drop effect. These observa-
tions suggest that the pronoun-drop effect is a consequence of failing to account for (i) varying effects
among language families and (ii) overrepresentation of the Indo-European languages. With these re-
sults, this article suggests that the theory of pronoun-drop effect should be thoroughly revised.
Additionally, the article provides several suggestions for many similar cross-cultural studies that suffer from the same problems as the pronoun-drop effect study.","pronoun drop, pro-drop, correlational studies, extra-linguistic factors, economy"

Strasser2014,"Scientific datasets have immeasurable value, but they lose their value over

shared. One unifying factor for many of these at-risk datasets is that they reside
in spreadsheets.

with Microsoft Research Connections and the Gordon and Betty Moore

minimizes the learning curve for researchers.
The DataUp project began in August 2011. We first formally assessed
the needs of researchers by conducting surveys and interviews of our target
research groups: earth, environmental, and ecological scientists. We found
that, on average, researchers had very poor data management practices, were
not aware of data centers or metadata standards, and did not understand the
benefits of data management or sharing. Based on our survey results, we
composed a list of desirable components and requirements and solicited
feedback from the community to prioritize potential features of the DataUp tool.

Concepts, they argue, must be compositional. It must be possible, if one accepts the
representational theory of mind, to explain how the meaning of a complex phrase is
based solely on the meaning of the elements from which it is constructed, plus the
syntactic structure into which they are placed. To account for our ability to
understand the meaning of sentences such as (1) and (2) and countless other similar
sentences the semantic system needs a set of fixed symbols to represent the con-
ceptual atoms in the sentences (John, Mary, Bill, loves, hates) which can then be
inserted into suitable syntactically structured sentence frames to yield the appro-
priate meaning for the sentence as a whole. [pb]

of combination. I will argue that the construction of complex concepts proceeds
(most naturally) through the interactive combination of the intensional meanings of
the individual concepts. Wherever two concepts are combined whose intensional
contents overlap or interact semantically, then extensional compositionality of
meaning will tend to fail. Moreover, if we consider thought rather than language,

Barsalou2017,"If a theory of concept composition aspires to psychological plausibility,
it may first need to address several preliminary issues associated with naturally
occurring human concepts: content variability, multiple representational forms, and
pragmatic constraints. Not only do these issues constitute a significant challenge for
explaining individual concepts, they pose an even more formidable challenge for
explaining concept compositions. How do concepts combine as their content
changes, as different representational forms become active, and as pragmatic con-
straints shape processing? Arguably, concepts are most ubiquitous and important in
compositions, relative to when they occur in isolation. Furthermore, entering into
compositions may play central roles in producing the changes in content, form, and
pragmatic relevance observed for individual concepts. Developing a theory of
concept composition that embraces and illuminates these issues would not only
constitute a significant contribution to the study of concepts, it would provide
insight into the nature of human cognition.","concept combination, compositionality, cognition, "
Barsalou2017,"From the perspective of human cognition, principles of conceptual processing have
potential implications for theories of concept composition. First, the content active
for a concept on a given occasion appears to vary considerably. Rather than having
a stable core, a concept exhibits dynamically varying content across situations,
perhaps resulting from Bayesian sampling. Second, multiple representational forms
may constitute the dynamically constructed representation of a concept on a given
occasion. Although these representations could include abstractions, they may also
include exemplars, and are at least likely to include exemplar-level information.
Additionally, multimodal simulations and distributed linguistic representations may
become active and play central roles in concept composition, along with amodal
symbols. On a given occasion, the specific mix of representational forms may vary
widely. Third, the dynamic representation of a concept on a given occasion is likely
to reflect a variety of pragmatic constraints. On the one hand, these representations
could contain conceptual content established through extensional feedback on
earlier occasions. On the other, they could contain information associated with the
current background situation.","compositionality, concept combination, "
Zeng2017,"Language classification is a matter of scale and scaling. Most basically, it
assigns languages into mutually exclusive categories. The scale underpins the
categorization but does not come from nowhere. It displays an historical
configuration and is invariably centered on the authoritative voice of science
(Gal 2016:95). Both linguistics and anthropology are essentially Western
disciplines that scale themselves up from provincial to universal sciences
(Chakrabarty 2008). For instance, comparative linguistics depends on the
expandability of the colonial project, which is best exemplified by the British
colonialization of India and the discovery of Indo-European linguistics
(Trautmann 1997). To understand the dialectical relationship between language
classification and political agenda, it is useful to follow the recent
conceptualization of scaling as pragmatics (Carr and Lempert 2016). Language
classification is necessarily political in terms of both pragmatic presupposition
(colonial exploration) and entailment (governing colonized territory).","language classification, Edward Sapir, Li Fang-Kuei, history of science, Na-Dene, Sino-Tibetan"

Barsalou2017,"From the grounded perspective, concepts are typically situated, that is, they
become active to process some aspect of the current physical situation (or a physical
situation in the past or future). Although concepts may sometimes become active
independently of a situation, they typically become active to support effective
action in a specific situation. As a result, concepts become coupled with their
physical referents. Although grounded theories of concepts have a long way to go
in developing satisfactory accounts of this coupling, they naturally anticipate it, and
provide many mechanisms for understanding and explaining it. Thus, grounded
theories offer an approach for unifying formalist and cognitivist accounts of con-
cepts, and further assume that neither approach alone is sufficient.","grounded theory of concepts"
Barsalou2017,"Researchers often assume that a concept has a core,
namely, important information about the respective category that is consistently
activated rapidly and automatically, independently of context.","conceptual core theory, introduction"
Barsalou2017,"When a given concept is combined with other concepts, its content is likely
to vary considerably across concept compositions. Even when the same two con-
cepts are combined on different occasions, their individual content is likely to vary,
especially when combined in different background situations.","concept combination, conceptual core theory"
Barsalou2017,"A related phenomenon is that the
varying content of a concept often appears to contain information relevant in the
current situation. In some of these cases, the information appears to be stored in
the concept, with the current situation selecting it as relevant (e.g., Barsalou 1982;
Conrad 1978; Greenspan 1986; Whitney et al. 1985).[...]
In other cases, varying content
appears to originate in background situations (e.g., Barsalou and Wiemer-Hastings,
2005; Papies 2013; Wu and Barsalou 2009).","situation-specific content, concepts, context"
Barsalou2017,"As we have just seen, the properties active for a concept
vary with context. As we also saw earlier, concepts may not be associated with
stable cores that are activated automatically. How, then, should we think about the
varying content of a concept?

One possibility is that conceptual content is sampled in a Bayesian manner; in
other words, sampling reflects both frequency of use and contextual relevance
(Barsalou 2011). In a given situation, information that has been processed fre-
quently across situations for the concept has a higher probability of becoming active
than information processed infrequently (e.g., round vs. floats for basketball).
Importantly, however, high probability information need not be core information,
becoming active on all occasions when the concept is processed. Rather than being
active obligatorily across situations, this information simply has a higher proba-
bility of being active than less frequent information. Depending on the context, high
probability information may or may not be active (Lebois et al. 2015).","Bayesian sampling, concepts, "
Barsalou2017,"If the conceptual content represented for a concept varies
dynamically across situations, how can a concept be represented in a general

potential solutions to this issue.","grounded theory of concepts, concept representation"
Barsalou2017,"First, the distributed network in the brain that aggregates multimodal information
for a concept across its exemplars offers a general representation of the respective
category. Because the network aggregates a tremendous amount of information
across experiences with the category, it doesn’t simply represent a single exemplar,
but represents all exemplars together (see the distinction between simulations and
simulators in Barsalou 1999, 2009, also 2016b).","exemplar theory, grounded theory of concepts, "
Barsalou2017,"Second, the most accessible simulation that can be easily constructed from the
network offers a default representation of the concept (cf. McNally and Boleda,
2017).","grounded theory of concepts, concept accessibility"
Barsalou2017,"Third, people may learn to explicitly construct specific simulations of a concept
that offer a generic representation of it (e.g., one that omits situational detail). To the
extent that people understand meta-cognitively that a concept can be general, they
may be able to construct a simulation that captures this generic character.","grounded theory of concepts, generalization"
Barsalou2017,"If the conceptual content represented for a concept varies
dynamically, how can individuals ever come to effectively share a common conceptual representation in a specific situation (cf. Pelletier, 2017)? One likely
solution to this problem follows from the facts that different individuals have
similar bodies, brains, and cognitive systems; they live in similar physical envi-
ronments; they operate in highly-coordinated social contexts. As a result, different
individuals acquire similar distributed networks for a given concept over the course
of development. Within a particular social group or culture, different individuals’
networks are likely to be highly similar, given similar coordinated experiences with
many shared exemplars. Even across different cultures, these networks are likely to
be highly similar, given that all humans have similar bodies, brains, and cognitive
systems, operating in similar physical and social environments.","conceptualization, motivation, conceptual representation, grounded theory of concepts"

DomazetLoso2011,"Motivation: Bacterial and viral genomes are often affected by
horizontal gene transfer observable as abrupt switching in local
homology. In addition to the resulting mosaic genome structure,
they frequently contain regions not found in close relatives, which
may play a role in virulence mechanisms. Due to this connection
to medical microbiology, there are numerous methods available to
detect horizontal gene transfer. However, these are usually aimed
at individual genes and viral genomes rather than the much larger
bacterial genomes. Here, we propose an efficient alignment-free
approach to describe the mosaic structure of viral and bacterial
genomes, including their unique regions.

Results: Our method is based on the lengths of exact matches
between pairs of sequences. Long matches indicate close homology,
short matches more distant homology or none at all. These
exact match lengths can be looked up efficiently using an
enhanced suffix array. Our program implementing this approach,
alfy (ALignment-Free local homologY), efficiently and accurately
detects the recombination break points in simulated DNA sequences

Escherichia coli genomes where we detect new evidence for the

of common nouns, and today proper names may be accompanied by classifiers
that have evolved from the definite article. Additionally, proper names show
particularities concerning their syntactical behavior, word-formation processes,
and orthography. While (most of) these developments provide evidence for
change, they can, at the same time, be functionally interpreted as strategies to
preserve the name shape for reasons of recognition. A second aim of this article

Arias2017,"**Objectives**

Northwestern Amazonia (NWA) is a center of high linguistic and cultural diversity. Several language families and linguistic isolates occur in this region, as well as different subsistence patterns, with some groups being foragers and others agriculturalists. In addition, speakers of Eastern Tukanoan languages are known for practicing linguistic exogamy, a marriage system in which partners are taken from different language groups. In this study, we use high-resolution mitochondrial DNA sequencing to investigate the impact of this linguistic and cultural diversity on the genetic relationships and population structure of NWA groups.

**Methods**

We collected saliva samples from individuals representing 40 different NWA ethnolinguistic groups and sequenced 439 complete mitochondrial genomes to an average coverage of 1,030×.

**Results**

The mtDNA data revealed that NWA populations have high genetic diversity with extensive sharing of haplotypes among groups. Moreover, groups who practice linguistic exogamy have higher genetic diversity, while the foraging Nukak have lower genetic diversity. We also find that rivers play a more important role than either geography or language affiliation in structuring the genetic relationships of populations.

**Discussion**

Contrary to the view of NWA as a pristine area inhabited by small human populations living in isolation, our data support a view of high diversity and contact among different ethnolinguistic groups, with movement along rivers probably facilitating this contact. Additionally, we provide evidence for the impact of cultural practices, such as linguistic exogamy, on patterns of genetic variation. Overall, this study provides new data and insights into a remote and little-studied region of the world.","population genetics, genetic diversity, Amazonia, "

Bastide2017,"The goal of Phylogenetic Comparative Methods (PCMs) is to study the distribution of quantitative traits among related species. The observed traits are often seen as the result of a Brownian Motion (BM) running along a phylogenetic tree. Reticulation events such as hybridization, gene flow or horizontal gene transfer, can substantially affect a species' traits, but are not modeled by a tree. Phylogenetic networks have been designed to represent reticulate evolution. As they become available for downstream analyses, new models of trait evolution are needed, applicable to networks. We develop here an efficient recursive algorithm to compute the phylogenetic variance matrix of a trait on a network, in only one preorder traversal of the network. We then extend the standard PCM tools to this new framework, including phylogenetic regression with covariates (or phylogenetic ANOVA), ancestral trait reconstruction, and Pagel's λ test of phylogenetic signal. The trait of a hybrid is sometimes outside of the range of its two parents'. Hybrid vigor and hybrid depression is indeed a rather common phenomenon observed in present-day hybrids. Transgressive evolution can be modeled as a shift in the trait value following a reticulation point. We develop a general framework to handle such shifts, and take advantage of the phylogenetic regression view of the problem to design statistical tests for ancestral transgressive evolution in the evolutionary history of a group of species. We study the power of these tests in several scenarios, and show that recent events have indeed the strongest impact on the trait distribution of present-day taxa.

Freedman2014,"To identify genetic changes underlying dog domestication and reconstruct their early evolutionary history, we generated
high-quality genome sequences from three gray wolves, one from each of the three putative centers of dog domestication,
two basal dog lineages (Basenji and Dingo) and a golden jackal as an outgroup. Analysis of these sequences supports a
demographic model in which dogs and wolves diverged through a dynamic process involving population bottlenecks in
both lineages and post-divergence gene flow. In dogs, the domestication bottleneck involved at least a 16-fold reduction in
population size, a much more severe bottleneck than estimated previously. A sharp bottleneck in wolves occurred soon
after their divergence from dogs, implying that the pool of diversity from which dogs arose was substantially larger than
represented by modern wolf populations. We narrow the plausible range for the date of initial dog domestication to an
interval spanning 11–16 thousand years ago, predating the rise of agriculture. In light of this finding, we expand upon
previous work regarding the increase in copy number of the amylase gene (AMY2B) in dogs, which is believed to have aided
digestion of starch in agricultural refuse. We find standing variation for amylase copy number variation in wolves and little
or no copy number increase in the Dingo and Husky lineages. In conjunction with the estimated timing of dog origins, these
results provide additional support to archaeological finds, suggesting the earliest dogs arose alongside hunter-gathers
rather than agriculturists. Regarding the geographic origin of dogs, we find that, surprisingly, none of the extant wolf
lineages from putative domestication centers is more closely related to dogs, and, instead, the sampled wolves form a sister
monophyletic clade. This result, in combination with dog-wolf admixture during the process of domestication, suggests that
a re-evaluation of past hypotheses regarding dog origins is necessary.","domestication, dog, population genetics, "

the default interpretation as the crucial fact to account for, leaving the non-default
interpretations in context unexplained. The second involves providing an analysis
that is weak enough to capture all interpretations, and saying little or nothing about
the strength of the default interpretation. In this paper, we argue that, in effect, both
routes must be taken because two fundamentally different interpretative processes
can be appealed to in the composition of modified noun phrases or, more generally, in
concept composition. Specifically, we take default interpretations to be the result of
what we will call conceptually afforded concept composition, and non-default inter-
pretations to be the result of referentially afforded concept composition.","definition, affordance, compositionality, concept combination"

Poortman2017,"This chapter studies the interpretations of plural sentences with con-
joined predicates, e.g. The boys are sitting and cooking and The boys are waving
and smiling. Such sentences are sometimes interpreted intersectively, sometimes
non-intersectively (or ‘split’), and sometimes both interpretations appear to be
allowed. This is surprising, since the logical structure of these sentences is identical,
i.e. they differ only with respect to content words (e.g. sitting, cooking vs. waving,
smiling). I propose that the logical interpretation of these sentences is systematically
affected by lexical information tied to the complex predicate in the sentences,
specifically their so-called typicality effects. With a set of experiments, I show that
(a) the acceptability of a sentence in a non-intersective situation can be expressed in
terms of a continuum and (b) each acceptability proportion is predicted by the
typicality of the two conjoined predicates applying simultaneously. This way, I
specify at least one of the relevant pragmatic considerations that determine the
interpretation of a plural sentence with conjunctive predicates. More generally,
these results stress the importance of conceptual structure of predicates in semantic
theories of language.","concept combination, plural, semantics, pragmatics"

Salisbury1999,"Strongest evidence (SE) is an approach to evaluating the support provided by characters for
in the context
alternative phylogenetic hypotheses (i.e., trees). Although first demonstrated
of parsimony, SE is equally applicable to compatibility analysis. In the logic of strongest
evidence, a character that is compatible with a phylogenetic hypothesis supports the tree
only to the degree at which this compatibility would be improbable under a model of
cladistic dissociation between character state distribution and the tree. The support measure
derived from this consideration is called the ""apparent
phylogenetic signal"" (APS). The total
support for a tree is the sum of the individual character APS values. Tree topology and
character structure both affect the chance of ""random"" compatibility and thus the APS
scores. Because a clique of compatible characters implies a specific tree (possibly more than
one if the character states are unordered or there are missing data), the evidential strength of
a clique may be measured as the SE support for the clique's tree by the clique's characters.
Use of this measure is demonstrated
on a morphological data set for North American spe-
cies of Chloris (Poaceae). Cliques with the same number of characters vary tremendously
in their apparent evidential quality. The strongest clique is nearly 100,000 times less likely
to be compatible by chance with the tree it implies than is the weakest clique of the same
size. This approach to clique evaluation is compared with character counting and

names do not have lexical meaning (or at most to a very limited extent);
accordingly, the relation between name and referent is direct and not mediated
via the lexical content as in the case of common nouns. Semantically, unique

quantification on dimensions. This approach correlates the acceptability of a given

Winter2017,"Compositional semantic frameworks often compute the extension of a
complex expression directly from the extensions of its parts. However, much work
in cognitive psychology has shown important challenges for compositional meth-
ods. For instance, Hampton (J Exp Psychol Learn Mem Cognit 14(1):12–32, 1988b)
showed that speakers may let the complex nominal sports that are games include
chess as one of its instances, without admitting chess in the extension of sports.
Similarly, Lee (2017) experimentally supports the common intuition that instances
of red hair are not necessarily categorized as red. This paper reviews further results
about plural quantifiers, showing similar challenges for compositionality. It is pro-
posed that typicality effects play a systematic role in compositional interpretation
and the determination of truth-values. For instance, the “overextension” effect in the
red hair example is predicted by the fact that focal red is an atypical hair color. Sim-
ilarly, in the plural sentence the men are walking and writing, the availability of the
split reading (“some men are walking and some men are writing”) increases due
to the atypicality of doing both activities at the same time (Poortman, 2017). Fur-
ther, in reciprocal sentences like the three men are pinching each other, the number
of pinching acts may be three. This is related to the atypicality of situations where
every man pinches two other men at the same time, as required by a strong interpre-
tation of each other. The paper gives a uniform account of truth-value judgements on
these different constructions, based on the identification of conflicts between typical
preferences.","compositionality, concept combination, truth value, gradability, typicality, interpretation"
Westerlund2017,"Within the cognitive neuroscience of language, the left anterior temporal
lobe (LATL) is one of the most consistent loci for semantic effects; yet its precise
role in semantic processing remains unclear. Here we focus on a literature showing
that the LATL is modulated by semantic composition even in the simplest of cases,
suggesting that it has a central role in the construction of complex meaning. We
show that while the LATL’s combinatory contribution generalizes across several
linguistic factors, such as composition type and word order, it is also robustly
modulated by conceptual factors such as the specificity of the composing words.
These findings suggest that the LATL’s role in composition is at the conceptual as
opposed to the syntactic or logico-semantic level, making formal semantic theories
of composition less obviously useful for guiding future research on the LATL. For
an alternative theoretical foundation, this chapter seeks to connect LATL research
to psychological models of conceptual combination, which potentially offer a more
fruitful space of hypotheses to constrain our understanding of the computations
housed in the LATL. We conclude that, though currently available data on the
LATL do not rule out relation-based models, they are most consistent with
schema-based models of conceptual combination, with the LATL potentially rep-

Using the Google Books corpus, coupled with two metadata-rich corpora of Anglophone fiction books, we show a decrease in emotionality in English-speaking literature starting plausibly in the nineteenth century. We show that this decrease cannot be explained by changes unrelated to emotionality (such as demographic dynamics concerning age or gender balance, changes in vocabulary richness, or changes in the prevalence of literary genres), and that, in our three corpora, the decrease is driven almost entirely by a decline in the proportion of positive emotion-related words, while the frequency of negative emotion-related words shows little if any decline. Consistently with previous studies, we also find a link between ageing and negative emotionality at the individual level.","big data, small data, Google N-Grams, word emotions"

Evans2016a,"There is something unique about human culture. Its complex technologies, customs,
institutions, symbolisms and norms, which are shared and maintained and improved
across countless generations, are what sets it apart from the ‘cultures’ of other
animals. The fundamental question that researchers are only just beginning to unravel
is: How do we account for the gap between their ‘cultures’ and ours? The answer lies
in a deeper understanding of culture’s complex constituent components: from the
micro-level psychological mechanisms that guide and facilitate accurate social
learning, to the macro-level cultural processes that unfold within large-scale
cooperative groups. This thesis attempts to contribute to two broad themes that are of
relevance to this question. The first theme involves the evolution of accurate and
high-fidelity cultural transmission. In Chapter 2, a meta-analysis conducted across
primate social learning studies finds support for the common assumption that
imitative and/or emulative learning mechanisms are required for the high-fidelity
transmission of complex instrumental cultural goals. Chapter 3, adopting an
experimental study with young children, then questions the claim that mechanisms of
high-fidelity copying have reached such heights in our own species that they will even
lead us to blindly copy irrelevant, and potentially costly, information. The second
theme involves investigations of the mutually reinforcing relationship predicted
between cultural complexity and ultra-cooperativeness in humans, employing a series
of laboratory-based experimental investigations with adults. Chapter 4 finds only dynamic might help to scaffold the evolution of increased cultural complexity and
cooperation in a learning environment where cultural information carries high value.","cultural evolution, social learning, imitation, emulation, "

chemical and molecular genetic approaches, and dating through

C accelerator mass spectrometry. We investigate the origin of
domesticated chili pepper, Capsicum annuum, by combining two
approaches, species distribution modeling and paleobiolinguis-

The combination of these four lines of evidence yields consensus
models indicating that domestication of C. annuum could have
occurred in one or both of two areas of Mexico: northeastern
Mexico and central-east Mexico. Genetic evidence shows more
support for the more northern location, but jointly all four lines
of evidence support central-east Mexico, where preceramic mac-
roremains of chili pepper have been recovered in the Valley of
Tehuacán. Located just to the east of this valley is the center of
phylogenetic diversity of Proto-Otomanguean, a language spo-
ken in mid-Holocene times and the oldest protolanguage for
which a word for chili pepper reconstructs based on historical
linguistics. For many crops, especially those that do not have
a strong archaeobotanical record or phylogeographic pattern, it
is difficult to precisely identify the time and place of their origin.
Our results for chili pepper show that expressing all data in sim-
ilar distance terms allows for combining contrasting lines of evi-
dence and locating the region(s) where cultivation and domestication
of a crop began.

**Significance**

The novelty of the information of this manuscript resides in the
addition of species distribution modeling and paleobiolin-
guistics data, combined with genetic and existing archae-
obotanical data, to trace back the geographic origin of a crop,
namely domesticated pepper, Capsicum annuum. Furthermore,
the utilization of a geographic framework of reference for the
four types of data has allowed us to combine these indepen-
dent data types into a single hypothesis about the origin of
this crop. Our results suggest that food crops in Mexico had
a multiregional origin with chili pepper originating in cen-
tral-east Mexico, maize in the Balsas River Basin and com-
mon bean in the Lerma–Santiago River Basin, resembling
similar finds for the Fertile Crescent and China.

variation. Statistical analysis works best when true uncertainty and variation

category A or B, it is preferable to explicitly reflect that uncertainty, rather than
arbitrarily choosing just B; or if x varies between A and B, it is preferable to
explicitly reflect that variation, rather than arbitrarily choosing just A. Likewise,

Round2017,"On pp. 71–74, Gordon compares the language-internal frequency of conso-

(r = 0.6). An outlier is/r/, whose rate of language-internal use is surprisingly
high, around double the expected value. A little digging shows that this boils
down to comparing like with like. The comparison of like with like is one of the
most challenging tasks of typology, since rarely are the “correct” categories
given in advance. In some cases though, it may be that cross-linguistic statistical
analysis furnishes evidence in favour of one option over another. In this
instance, Gordon’s source for cross-linguistic frequency is seminal work by
Maddieson (1984), which carefully distinguishes trills/r/from taps/ɾ/. One result
of that analytical choice is that trills/r/are cross-linguistically less than half as
frequent as/l/, a finding which might seem counter-intuitive. Alternatively, if we
opt to collapse all instances of non-contrastive/r/and/ɾ/into a single category,
then two things happen. The cross-linguistic frequency of combined/r ~ ɾ/
approximately matches that of/l/. Furthermore, the cross-linguistic frequency
of /r ~ ɾ/ is almost exactly the rate predicted from language-internal frequency,
according to the general relationship that Gordon finds for most consonants.

Round2017,"The first
paradox is that analysis inherently involves the removal of certain dimensions of
variation from the dataset; it does so not randomly but systematically, and it
does so prior to statistical analysis, which in an ideal world ought not to
happen. The second paradox is that when, having weighed up the inevitably
somewhat conflicting evidence that any language will present us with, we
decide definitively in favour of analysis A and not analysis B, our definitive
act removes aspects of real uncertainty, 7 and does so prior to statistical analysis.
The third paradox is that overall analyses are the product of applying many
small analytic procedures, in which decisions are made according to criteria
over which linguists differ with one another (Chao 1934; Hockett 1963; Hyman

Gibbon2017,"Multilinear Grammar provides a framework for integrating the many different syntagmatic

Each rank has unique structures and its own semantic-pragmatic and prosodic-phonetic interpretation

Condition: incremental processing in linear time with finite working memory. We suggest that the Rank
Interpretation Architecture and its multilinear properties provide systematic design features of human

ontogeny of language, and clarifies a range of challenges for the evaluation of realistic linguistic theories

turns out to be a hybrid system with interfaces between component subsystems. It is not impossible that
this concept provides an adequate approach to understanding human language abilities and to language
development in acquisition or evolution, subsystem by subsystem.[pb] economy of descriptive and explanatory means, it is a wasteful strategy. There are recent – or revived –

is an empirically implausible assumption in view of the limited working memory and linear real-time
processing of speech, and even of the more relaxed constraints on writing. Overly powerful formalisms are
being abandoned in many contexts, either in favour of flat linear grammars, or in favour of more complex
grammars which are nevertheless constrained to have only finite working memory requirements.","grammatical theory, flat grammar, centre-embedded constructions"
Gibbon2017,"Second, it remains uncontested that semantic interpretation and disambiguation may sometimes
require arbitrarily complex structures in order to express the full complexity of general cognition and
cultural context. But this does not necessarily apply to grammar in the narrow sense, which basically
needs to account for the combinatorial facts of language varieties. A thought experiment may help to
clarify. Imagine someone attending a lecture in a subject in which they have no training: the grammar is
recognisable, but it is largely devoid of content for that listener, except for structurally local contributions
of inflectional morphology, articles, auxiliary verbs, prepositions and conjunctions.","flat grammar, semantics, "
Gibbon2017,"The relevant procedural properties of algorithms for
processing these, and more complex, grammars are detailed by @Kay<1980> (1980). In computational contexts these
results are well-known, but in linguistic discussions they tend to be sidelined by @Chomsky<1957>’s early theorem
(1957:21, example 9): *English is not a finite-state language*. Chomsky’s theorem applies – with certain
restrictions – to the complexities of written language and rehearsed speech, because these varieties have at
their disposal additional memory resources and more leisurely time windows which to some extent support
the additional temporal and storage requirements of centre-embedded constructions. But Chomsky’s
theorem does not apply to non-practised spontaneous speech which is produced and understood on the
spur of the moment, is restricted to a working memory with a rather small finite bound (Church 1980) and
is error-prone on more complex tasks.","nice quote, Noam Chomsky, Chomsky syntax, finite state grammar, English, "

of the heterogeneity of language varieties on the basis of both structural and procedural plausibility criteria

limited working memory if the goal is empirical realism.","performance, competence, Chomsky syntax, critics"
Gibbon2017,"We claim that the centre-embedding
emerges as a generalisation of non-centre-embedding recursion on the different time scales of spontaneous
speech improvisation, of language acquisition, of the history of language change and of language evolution,

about the triggering of recursion by genetic mutation (though not excluding this possibility).","centre-embedded constructions, center embedding, emergence, language evolution"

from strictly semantic constraints, then linearity is the appropriate default for structure and process in
speech, and hierarchical structuring is just needed for rather rare instances of centre-embedded recursion
in speech, which only occurs with severe depth constraints (Section 6).

The Procedural Plausibility Condition
which justifies default flat grammars is valid at all ranks:

1 at discourse rank, for example for adjacency pairs, question-answer-confirmation triples and their
iterations;
2 at utterance rank, to describe narration and argument patterns;
3 at phrasal rank, modelled by left branching or right branching structures;

Gibbon2017,"Following one common terminological convention, a grammar G for a language L is a theory consisting of

1 a set of general premises (the grammar rules),
2 a specific premise, i.e. a minimal string consisting of a single symbol, such as A.
3 an inference procedure which uses the specific premise as an initial theorem, to infer a set of derived theorems from the general premises by modus ponens until no more general premises apply, finally yielding sets of theorems such as {big, small, very big, very small, very very big, very very small, ...}. The inference procedure is very familiar to linguists.","grammar, definition, "
Gibbon2017,"A theory such as the grammar G is understood here as a description of a model: an interpretation
function maps theorems of the grammar to a domain of structures, either abstract structures or structures
representing observed reality. The model is thus an interpretation of the theory. Prosodic-phonetic
interpretations in terms of externally observable physical events at each rank are one kind of model for the
part of the theory which pertains to that rank. The semantic-pragmatic interpretations are a second kind of
model. A third kind of model for the theory is a set of rooted ordered tree graphs: the phrase structures of
linguistic analysis, reflecting the theorem inference process, with the initial theorem and the elements of
the right-hand sides of the ‘→’ premises as nonterminal nodes, and leaf nodes corresponding to elements
of the sets in the ‘=’ premises.

A fourth type of model for a theory is a procedural model, expressed in terms of specific algorithms
and data structures, and possibly implemented as a computer program. Depending on the type of premise,
different types of procedural model may be defined. For instance, a purely right branching or purely left
branching grammar (but not a mixture of the two types) can be mapped to a finite state automaton model
and straightforwardly implemented in a programming language.

process under the real-time conditions of speech, as it relies on unlimited working memory to link left and
right contexts of arbitrarily deep centre-embeddings: the man...fetched the police, who the boy...called, who
the dog bit. This problem does not occur with unidirectionally branching grammars. If a centre-embedded
sentence like the zebra whose skin, which a man from Orlando bought illegally, got lost was the last of its
species is analysable, it is because the semantic-pragmatic interpretations with their cultural associations [pb]
at each level of embedding are very different, and because writing provides additional working memory on
the page, and additional processing time. It is not not because the syntax itself has intrinsically tractable
combinatorial properties. A sentence like the man whose car the man who the other man saw saw saw the
man is puzzling, to say the least; there is no support for centre-embedding from phrasal syntax alone.","semantics, centre-embedded constructions, center embedding, examples"

2 The centre-embedding generalisation is enabled by the registers of writing and rehearsed speech, which have enhanced paper or screen working memory capacity and allow increased processing time.

has been shown for Slavic languages by @Kilbury<1997> (1997), @Kilbury<2004> & Bontcheva (2004) and @Kilbury<2011> et al. (2011).
Grimm’s Law, Verner’s Law and the High German Soundshift can also be modelled fairly straightforwardly
by finite state transducers. In fact, transducers for Grimm’s Law and Verner’s Law can be composed into
a single transducer, showing complementary environments for the two laws, thereby indicating that the
laws are intrinsically unordered, whatever their actual temporal order, and not necessarily ordered, as the
traditional controversy would have it.  This was first shown by @Kindt<1978> and Wirrer (1978) with their transducer-related separation of Stellenzuordnung (position assignment) and Korrelationsbeziehung (correlation
connection). It is tempting to speculate that developments on the evolutionary time scale TSphyl are also

basic visual preferences, but little is known about the history and mechanisms of that evolution.
Cognitive constraints have been documented for the topology of script features, but not for their

that cardinal (vertical and horizontal) orientations, being easier to process, should be overrepre-

Park2017,"Excavated bamboo or wooden manuscripts dating from the 5th to 3rd
centuries BCE have now become important new sources of data for Old
Chinese phonology. The ways these sources are interpreted are
necessarily based on methodological assumptions for Old Chinese
reconstruction. So when debated issues in the latter are involved,
disparate observations about the same materials turn out to manifest
differences in the methodologies themselves. The study of Old Chinese
through excavated manuscripts seems to become further complicated by
considerations of the nature of the ‘pre-Qin’ archaic script and the
provenances of the manuscripts. In response to these problems, as argued
in this article, it is essential to recognize that the writings from the
ancient Chu and Qin regions, notwithstanding the impressive range of
graphic variability reaffirm the logographic nature of the Chinese writing
system. The imperial ‘script-unification’ of the Qin dynasty was primarily
an orthographic standardization in accordance with the norms of the old [pb]
Qin region, whereby distinct regional variants were purged and
preexisting internal variants were diminished. This by no means
implicated such a drastic change in the writing system as a syllabary
transforming to a logography. It is therefore necessary that the principles
of OC reconstruction should be applied consistently to both the excavated
archaic-script writings and transmitted early Chinese textual sources. It
should be maintained first of all that the xiesheng (shared-phonophorics)
and Shijing (the Book of Odes) rhymes in principle converge on a single
phonological system, even though the actual history of the former is most
probably older than the latter. This leads us to suppose about the OC
vowel system that the Rounded Vowel Hypothesis does not hold, and that
excavated texts have not yielded any data suggesting otherwise. Instead,
this article suggests an alternative analysis of Middle Chinese (MC) -w- <
*-w- which can explain the problem in the conventional OC rhyme
classification concerning the Hypothesis. In the same vein, Chu and Qin
writings in each case exhibit the early Chinese xiesheng series which had
been received until that time; the regional variants thereof can
complement each other as evidence for the Old Chinese phonology. When
elements of dialects are found sporadically in the late archaic script,
whether in Chu or Qin manuscripts, one may reasonably suspect that they
reflect dialect-borrowings layered within the Old Chinese language.","Old Chinese, Chinese writing system, linguistic reconstruction, Baxter-Sagar System, rhyme patterns, excavated manuscripts"

Kassian2017,"This paper deals with the problem of linguistic homoplasy (parallel or
backward development), how it can be detected, what kinds of linguistic homoplasy
can be distinguished and which varieties of the phenomenon are the most deleterious
for the reconstruction of language phylogeny. It is proposed that language phylogeny
reconstruction should consist of two main stages. Firstly, a strict consensus tree
should be built on the basis of high-quality input data elaborated with the help of
the main phylogenetic methods (such as Neighbor-joining, Bayesian MCMC, and
Maximum parsimony), and ancestral character states, allowing us to reveal a certain
number of homoplastic characters. Secondly, after the detected instances of homo-
plasy are eliminated from the input matrix, the consensus tree is to be compiled again.
It is expected that after homoplastic optimization it will be possible to better resolve
individual “problem clades”, and generally the homoplasy-optimized phylogeny
should be more robust than the tree constructed initially. The proposed procedure is
tested on the 110-item Swadesh wordlists of the Lezgian and Tsezic groups. The
Lezgian and Tsezic results generally support theoretical expectations. The MLN

Fuhhop2016,"Traditionally, contemporary German is considered to be rich in affixes which is displayed by a
wide range of e. g. nominal suffixes (such as -ung, -heit, -nis, -tum, -sal). However, productivity
tests, especially with non-native lexemes, challenge this view since many formal restrictions
between affixes and different word classes can be formally identified – synchronically and di-
achronically – and which cannot be explained by traditional approaches. This paper questions
the general morphological productivity of derivation coinciding with a decrease of nominal,
adjectival and verbal affixation and, in parallel, pointing to morphological alternatives. In this
view, a process of an increasing “syntactification” (as it will be called) is taking place resulting
in a morphological preference for conversion. Diachronically, the morphological development
from compounding to derivation is well-described. The question as to why and how conversion
emerges, especially in an inflectional language, and how it is linked to former or coexisting
morphological types, here derivation, has never been asked – though important observations
from language typology have been made. Against this background, the process of syntactifica-

an ongoing language change consisting of a change in linguistic encoding.","word derivation, productivity, German, word formation"

Gast2016,"This article contains some thoughts on the role of bilingual cognition in the diachronic change

typology of paradigm change is proposed, based on a distinction between three levels of linguistic
organization (the sign/Level 1, the category/Level 2, and the dimension/Level 3), and two types
of change (neutralization and differentiation), thus distinguishing six types of paradigm change.
Examples of these types (taken from the pertinent literature) are discussed, and two questions are
addressed in each case: (i) To what extent does contact-induced paradigm change of a specific type
differ from internal change? (ii) What are (potentially) the underlying cognitive processes motivating
each type of change? The hypothesis is explored that there is a correlation between the three levels
of analysis and three types of cognitive processes involved in paradigm change. It is suggested that
change at Level 1 is typically based on analogy, change at Level 2 is often sensitive to frequency
of use, and change at Level 3 may imply conceptual transfer, as discussed in recent work on weak
relativity effects in the context of bilingual cognition.","paradigms, analogy, language change, morphological change"

Shizuka2016,"The existence of discrete social clusters, or ‘communities’, is a common feature of social networks in
human and nonhuman animals. The level of such community structure in networks is typically measured
using an index of modularity, Q. While modularity quantifies the degree to which individuals associate
within versus between social communities and provides a useful measure of structure in the social
network, it assumes that the network has been well sampled. However, animal social network data is
typically subject to sampling errors. In particular, the associations among individuals are often not
sampled equally, and animal social network studies are often based on a relatively small set of obser-
vations. Here, we extend an existing framework for bootstrapping network metrics to provide a method
for assessing the robustness of community assignment in social networks using a metric we call com-
munity assortativity (r com ). We use simulations to demonstrate that modularity can reliably detect the
transition from random to structured associations in networks that differ in size and number of com-
munities, while community assortativity accurately measures the level of confidence based on the
detectability of associations. We then demonstrate the use of these metrics using three publicly available
data sets of avian social networks. We suggest that by explicitly addressing the known limitations in
sampling animal social network, this approach will facilitate more rigorous analyses of population-level
structural patterns across social systems.","networks, graph theory, assortativity, modularity, community structure"

Prince2015,"The alienability distinction has long been recognized as one of the major factors driving differential marking of possession across
languages. But opinions are divided on its exact nature. I will bring evidence from the Oceanic language Daakaka to support the
hypotheses that the alienability distinction is not a lexical property of nouns but a property of possessive relations: speakers can choose
between different constructions depending on the relation between the possessor and the possessed that they wish to express.
Secondly, lexically non-relational nouns can be transitivized to express inalienable relations. And thirdly, the basic semantic notion
behind alienable possession is control.","alienability, Daakaka, language typology, "
Prince2015,"This language-specific finding also has implications for our understanding of the alienability distinction more generally.
According to Nichols (1988:568), a cross-linguistically valid definition of the distinction between alienable and inalienable
possession is not possible. Chappell and McGregor (1996b) take the more optimistic stance that given sufficient
background knowledge about the cultural and pragmatic context, predictions about the classification of specific relations
should be possible. They suggest that only those relations that are conceptualized in a given culture as particularly close
will be classified as inalienable. However, both accounts, as well as most of the literature on the alienability distinction,
have focused on the difference between lexically relational and non-relational nouns. But lexically encoded information is
bound to include unpredictable and idiosyncratic features. For example, in some languages, clothes and personal
belongings pattern with prototypically inalienable relations, while in other they pattern with alienable ones Chappell and
McGregor (1996b). Such cross-linguistic differences may well reflect culture-specific preferences and ideas.","island of order, alienability, lexicon, "

in languages where non-planar sentences abound. However, whether a number is small or large is a matter of the scale or

vegetation; ‘‘sculpting’’ of a terminal hook from the
nodal joint; and often additional adjustments, such
as length trimming, shaft bending, and bark stripping

share key design features [4, 6, 8], they vary appre-
ciably in overall shape and hook dimensions. Using
wild-caught, temporarily captive crows, we experi-
mentally investigated causes and consequences of
variation in hook-tool morphology. We found that
bird age, manufacture method, and raw-material
properties influenced tool morphology, and that
hook geometry in turn affected crows’ foraging effi-
ciency. Specifically, hook depth varied with both
detachment technique and plant rigidity, and deeper
hooks enabled faster prey extraction in the provided
tasks. Older crows manufactured tools of distinctive
shape, with pronounced shaft curvature and hooks
of intermediate depth. Future work should explore
the interactive effects of extrinsic and intrinsic fac-
tors on tool production and deployment. Our study
provides a quantitative assessment of the drivers
and functional significance of tool shape variation

Roebroeks2017,"he database regarding the earliest occupation of Europe has increased significantly in
quantity and quality of data points over the last two decades, mainly through the addition of
new sites as a result of long-term systematic excavations and large-scale prospections of Early
and early Middle Pleistocene exposures. The site distribution pattern suggests an ephemeral
presence of hominins in the south of Europe from around one million years ago, with
occasional short northward expansions along the western coastal areas when temperate
conditions permitted. From around 600,000-700,000 years ago Acheulean artefacts appear in
Europe and somewhat later hominin presence seems to pick up, with more sites and now
some also present in colder climatic settings. It is again only later, around 350,000 years ago,
that the first sites show up in more continental, central parts of Europe, east of the Rhine.
A series of recent papers on the Early Pleistocene palaeontological site of Untermassfeld
(Germany) makes claims that are of great interest for studies of earliest Europe and are at
odds with the described pattern: the papers suggest that Untermassfeld has yielded stone tools
and humanly modified faunal remains, evidence for a one million years old hominin presence
in European continental mid-latitudes, and additional evidence that hominins were well-
established in Europe already around that time period. Here we evaluate these claims and
demonstrate that these studies are severely flawed in terms of data on provenance of the
materials studied and in the interpretation of faunal remains and lithics as testifying to a
hominin presence at the site. In actual fact any reference to the Untermassfeld site as an
archaeological one is unwarranted. Furthermore, it is not the only European Early Pleistocene
site where inferred evidence for hominin presence is problematic. The strength of the
spatiotemporal patterns of hominin presence and absence depend on the quality of the data
points we work with, and data base maintenance, including critical evaluation of new sites, is
crucial to advance our knowledge of the expansions and contractions of hominin ranges
during the Pleistocene.","archaeology, data quality, sustainability, sustainable research"

Vukovic2017,"To help us live in the three-dimensional world, our brain integrates incoming spatial
information into reference frames, which are based either on our own body (egocentric) or
independent from it (allocentric). Such frames, however, may be crucial not only when
interacting with the visual world, but also in language comprehension, since even the simplest
utterance can be understood from different perspectives. While significant progress has been
made in elucidating how linguistic factors, such as pronouns, influence reference frame adoption,
the neural underpinnings of this ability are largely unknown. Building on the neural reuse
framework, this study tested the hypothesis that reference frame processing in language
comprehension involves mechanisms used in navigation and spatial cognition. We recorded EEG
activity in 28 healthy volunteers to identify spatiotemporal dynamics in (1) spatial navigation,
and (2) a language comprehension task (sentence-picture matching). By decomposing the EEG
signal into a set of maximally independent activity patterns, we localised and identified a subset
of components which best characterised perspective-taking in both domains. Remarkably, we
find individual co-variability across these tasks: people’s strategies in spatial navigation are also
reflected in their construction of sentential perspective. Furthermore, a distributed network of
cortical generators of such strategy-dependent activity responded not only in navigation, but in
sentence comprehension. Thus we report, for the first time, evidence for shared brain
mechanisms across these two domains - advancing our understanding of language’s interaction
with other cognitive systems, and the individual differences shaping comprehension.","spatial navigation systems, cortical network, empirical study, neurolinguistics, shared brain mechanisms, cognition,"
Widmer2017,"Some languages constrain the recursive embedding of NPs to some specific morphosyntactic
types, allowing it, for example, only with genitives but not with bare juxtaposition. In Indo-Euro-
pean, every type of NP embedding—genitives, adjectivizers, adpositions, head marking, or juxta-
position—is unavailable for syntactic recursion in at least one attested language. In addition,
attested pathways of change show that NP types that allow recursion can emerge and disappear in
less than 1,000 years. This wide-ranging synchronic diversity and its high diachronic dynamics
raise the possibility that at many hypothetical times in the history of the family recursive NP em-
bedding could have been lost for all types simultaneously, parallel to what has occasionally been
observed elsewhere (Everett 2005, Evans & Levinson 2009).
Performing Bayesian phylogenetic analyses on a sample of fifty-five languages from all branches
of Indo-European, we show, however, that it is extremely unlikely for such a complete loss to ever
have occurred. When one or more morphosyntactic types become unavailable for syntactic recur-
sion in an NP, an unconstrained alternative type is very likely to develop in the same language. This
suggests that, while diachronic pathways away from NP recursion clearly exist, there is a ten-
dency—perhaps a universal one—to maintain or develop syntactic recursion in NPs. A likely ex-
planation for this evolutionary bias is that recursively embedded phrases are not just an option that
languages have (Fitch et al. 2005), but they are in fact preferred by our processing system.","Indo-European, recursion, embedding, syntax, "

This article designs a method of improving traditional, qualitative semantic maps based on grammaticalisation paths, by including both quantitative data (frequency) and information concerning a gram’s environment (the relation to the other maps). The incorporation of qualitative evidence transforms vectored maps into waves, while the introduction of the contextual factor combines waves organised along the same grammaticalisation template into a stream. The structure of a wave delivers, in turn, the statistical prototypicality of a gram (i.e. the prototypicality that is conditioned by the gram’s own wave), whereas the structure of the stream yields product prototypicality (i.e. the prototypicality that is a combination of the gram’s wave and the other waves of the stream).

It occurs when researchers try out several statistical analyses and/or data eligibility specifications and then selectively report those that produce significant results [12–15]. Common practices that lead to p-hacking include: conducting analyses midway through experiments to decide whether to continue collecting data [15,16]; recording many response variables and deciding which to report postanalysis [16,17], deciding whether to include or drop outliers postanalyses [16], excluding, combining, or splitting treatment groups postanalysis [2], including or excluding covariates postanalysis [14], and stopping data exploration if an analysis yields a significant p-value [18,19].","p-hacking, selective reporting, definition, introduction"

In some cases, the phonetic and formal make up suggests a correlation of remote antiquity, yet in many instances it is difficult to establish a chronology. Most of the isoglosses involve cultural borrowing, with the direction of borrowing unclear, but a significant number (the considerable correspondences in the names of body parts, grammatical particles) may point to a closer genetic relationship.","Burushaki, language isolate, Indo-European, genetic relationship, long-range comparison"

along southern and northern routes of interaction between east and west. To begin, crop translocations from the Near East across India and Central
Asia are examined for wheat (Triticum aestivum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare) from the eighth to the second millennia BC when they reach China. The
case of pulses and flax (Linum usitatissimum) that only complete this journey in Han times (206 BC–AD 220), often never fully adopted, is also addressed.
The discussion then turns to the Chinese millets, Panicum miliaceum and Setaria italica, peaches (Amygdalus persica) and apricots (Armeniaca vulgaris),
tracing their movement from the fifth millennium to the second millennium BC when the Panicum miliaceum reaches Europe and Setaria italica Northern
India, with peaches and apricots present in Kashmir and Swat. Finally, the translocation of japonica rice from China to India that gave rise to indica rice
is considered, possibly dating to the second millennium BC. The routes these crops travelled include those to the north via the Inner Asia Mountain
Corridor, across Middle Asia, where there is good evidence for wheat, barley and the Chinese millets. The case for japonica rice, apricots and peaches is
less clear, and the northern route is contrasted with that through northeast India, Tibet and west China. Not all these journeys were synchronous, and

first establishing what kinds of changes qualify as phonetic changes for the

phonetic change. These include (a) the way phonological contrast can lead
to phonetic dispersion, (b) the way phonological natural classes can define a
set of segments to undergo a parallel phonetic shift, and (c) how phonological

when in human ontogeny such a motivation emerges and whether the motivation is shared by chimpanzees. Chimpanzees and
four- to six-year-old children learned through direct interaction that an agent was either prosocial or antisocial and later saw
each agent’s punishment. They were given the option to invest physical effort (chimpanzees) or monetary units (children) to
continue watching. Chimpanzees and six-year-olds showed a preference for watching punishment of the antisocial agent. An
additional control experiment in chimpanzees suggests that these results cannot be attributed to more generic factors such as
scene coherence or informational value seeking. This indicates that both six-year-olds and chimpanzees have a motivation to
watch deserved punishment enacted.","punishment, chimpanzees, pre-school children, antisocial behaviour"
Francois2017,"Linguistic diffusion is commonly equated with contact, and contrasted with geneal-

the heart of language genealogy itself. Indeed, the Comparative method has taught
us to identify genetic subgroups based on sets of shared innovations; but each
of these innovations necessarily had to diffuse from speaker to speaker across
a ­network of then mutually intelligible idiolects. Such a diffusionist approach to
language genealogy allows us to model language change as it really took place in
the social and geographical space of past societies.
Crucially, the entangled isoglosses typical of dialect continuums and linkages
(Ross 1988) cannot be handled by the Tree model, which is solely based on diver-
gence; but they are easily captured by a diffusionist approach such as the Wave
model, where the key process is convergence. After comparing the theoretical
underpinnings of these two models, I introduce Historical Glottometry, a new quan-
titative approach aiming to free the Comparative Method from any cladistic assump-

The internal relationship among these dialects has remained a puzzle, and the study of Min classification is still considered one of the most challenging tasks in Chinese dialectology. The present article applies a new approach, subgrouping, to solve the problem of classifying the 12 representative Min dialects. The study begins with a review of 0210; 0215 ;  0230 Proto-Min system and revises this system based on more comprehensive data. The revised Proto-Min system is then compared with the modern Min dialects to arrive at 39 shared innovations that constitute criteria for subgrouping. A phylogenetic tree model processed by the PENNY program (from PHYLIP, a package of computer programs for inferring phylogenies; Phylogeny Inference Package, version 3.695) displays the result of Min subgrouping based on maximum parsimony. The phylogenetic results derived through this method are shown to differ significantly from the traditional classification of Min dialects.

also quantified extensive horizontal language transfers among these dialects,
corresponding to the complicated socio-genetic history in China. We finally identified

communities sometimes develop languages with great structural complexity.
Paradoxically, the opposite pattern appears to be observed for non-structural
properties of language such as vocabulary size. These apparently opposite
patterns pose a challenge for theories of language change and evolution.
We use computational simulations to show that this inverse pattern can
depend on a single factor: ease of diffusion through the population. A popu-
lation of interacting agents was arranged on a network, passing linguistic
conventions to one another along network links. Agents can invent new con-
ventions, or replicate conventions that they have previously generated
themselves or learned from other agents. Linguistic conventions are either
Easy or Hard to diffuse, depending on how many times an agent needs to
encounter a convention to learn it. In large groups, only linguistic conventions
that are easy to learn, such as words, tend to proliferate, whereas small groups
where everyone talks to everyone else allow for more complex conventions,
like grammatical regularities, to be maintained. Our simulations thus suggest
that language, and possibly other aspects of culture, may become simpler at
the structural level as our world becomes increasingly interconnected.","grammar, lexicon, language evolution, linguistic complexity, simulation studies, artificial agents"

questionnaire design perspective on comprehensibility (as represented by the 2010, 2011 and

clarity requirement. To illustrate how intralingual translation in the form of plain language
practice can operationalise comprehensibility (Nisbeth Jensen 2015), a short case study is

translation endeavour. A client had a copyrighted medical research questionnaire, originally in

provider was not allowed any interventions in the source text. Testing of this questionnaire and
its translations then revealed that the questionnaires were incomprehensible to their

of the questionnaire are classified in terms of the four parameters that Zethsen (2009) has
identified in this regard, namely knowledge, time, culture and space. In addition, a fourfold text
assessment checklist for ensuring clarity in questionnaires is proposed. This checklist may

recognize parasite genomes and trigger their inactivation. The nucleic acid-guided defense systems include prokaryotic

interference (RNAi) in eukaryotes. The archaeal pAgo machinery is the direct ancestor of eukaryotic RNAi that, however,
acquired additional components, such as Dicer, and enormously diversified through multiple duplications. In contrast,
eukaryotes lack any heritage of the CRISPR-Cas systems, conceivably, due to the cellular toxicity of some Cas proteins

Schreier2018,"This article explores major processes that operate in new dialect forma-
tion, with a focus on the effects of various kinds of isolation of communities
and their speakers. A sociolinguistic approach concentrates on competition
and selection between transplanted dialect features and mechanisms such
as mixing, leveling, simplification, and reallocation. With reference to the
established (yet not uncontroversial) concept of the feature pool, the ques-
tion is how contact between distinct systems gives rise to localized forms.
From a more socially oriented perspective, the question is how the inte-
gration and segregation of groups contributes to or shapes the emergence
and disappearance of dialects. Isolation as a sociolinguistic concept is not
thoroughly defined, particularly at the intergroup, societal, or even national
level; therefore, geographic, social, and psychological factors need to be dis-
cussed and assessed. The processes investigated here are koinéization and
dialect/language shift, illustrated with examples from all over the world.","dialect formation, isolated communities, review, overview, koinéization, koine, sociolinguistic isolation"
Hartwigsen2017,"The adaptive potential of the language network to compensate for lesions remains
elusive. We show that perturbation of a semantic region in the healthy brain induced suppression
of activity in a large semantic network and upregulation of neighbouring phonological areas. After
perturbation, the disrupted area increased its inhibitory influence on another semantic key node.
The inhibitory influence predicted the individual delay in response speed, indicating that inhibition
at remote nodes is functionally relevant. Individual disruption predicted the upregulation of
semantic activity in phonological regions. In contrast, perturbation over a phonological region
suppressed activity in the network and disrupted behaviour without inducing upregulation. The
beneficial contribution of a neighbouring network might thus depend on the level of functional
disruption and may be interpreted to reflect a differential compensatory potential of distinct
language networks. These results might reveal generic mechanisms of plasticity in cognitive
networks and inform models of language reorganization.","neurolinguistics, semantic network, phonological network, "

James Buckheit and David Donoho proposed more than two decades ago that an article
about computational results is advertising, not scholarship. The actual scholarship is
the full software environment, code, and data that produced the result. This implies
new workflows, in particular in peer-reviews. Existing journals have been slow to
adapt: source codes are rarely requested and are hardly ever actually executed to check
that they produce the results advertised in the article. ReScience is a peer-reviewed
journal that targets computational research and encourages the explicit replication
of already published research, promoting new and open-source implementations in
order to ensure that the original research can be replicated from its description. To
achieve this goal, the whole publishing chain is radically different from other traditional
scientific journals. ReScience resides on GitHub where each new implementation of

Broido2018,"A central claim in modern network science is that real-world networks are typically “scale free,”
meaning that the fraction of nodes with degree k follows a power law, decaying like k −α , often with
2 < α < 3. However, empirical evidence for this belief derives from a relatively small number of
real-world networks. We test the universality of scale-free structure by applying state-of-the-art
statistical tools to a large corpus of nearly 1000 network data sets drawn from social, biological,
technological, and informational sources. We fit the power-law model to each degree distribution,
test its statistical plausibility, and compare it via a likelihood ratio test to alternative, non-scale-
free models, e.g., the log-normal. Across domains, we find that scale-free networks are rare, with
only 4% exhibiting the strongest-possible evidence of scale-free structure and 52% exhibiting the
weakest-possible evidence. Furthermore, evidence of scale-free structure is not uniformly distributed
across sources: social networks are at best weakly scale free, while a handful of technological and
biological networks can be called strongly scale free. These results undermine the universality of
scale-free networks and reveal that real-world networks exhibit a rich structural diversity that will
likely require new ideas and mechanisms to explain.","scale-free network, graph theory, small world network, "

similarity functions to generate rare word embeddings. We augmented pre-trained word embed-

3 times improvement in correlation over the original set of embeddings. Applying our technique

Takahira2016,"One of the fundamental questions about human language is whether its entropy rate is
positive. The entropy rate measures the average amount of information communicated per unit
time. The question about the entropy of language dates back to experiments by Shannon in 1951,
but in 1990 Hilberg raised doubt regarding a correct interpretation of these experiments. This article
provides an in-depth empirical analysis, using 20 corpora of up to 7.8 gigabytes across six languages
(English, French, Russian, Korean, Chinese, and Japanese), to conclude that the entropy rate is
positive. To obtain the estimates for data length tending to infinity, we use an extrapolation function
given by an ansatz. Whereas some ansatzes were proposed previously, here we use a new stretched
exponential extrapolation function that has a smaller error of fit. Thus, we conclude that the entropy
rates of human languages are positive but approximately 20% smaller than without extrapolation.
Although the entropy rate estimates depend on the script kind, the exponent of the ansatz function
turns out to be constant across different languages and governs the complexity of natural language in
general. In other words, in spite of typological differences, all languages seem equally hard to learn,
which partly confirms Hilberg’s hypothesis.","entropy, corpus studies, NLP, Shannon"

Koplenig2017,"Languages employ different strategies to transmit structural and grammatical information.
While, for example, grammatical dependency relationships in sentences are mainly con-
veyed by the ordering of the words for languages like Mandarin Chinese, or Vietnamese, the
word ordering is much less restricted for languages such as Inupiatun or Quechua, as these
languages (also) use the internal structure of words (e.g. inflectional morphology) to mark
grammatical relationships in a sentence. Based on a quantitative analysis of more than
1,500 unique translations of different books of the Bible in almost 1,200 different languages
that are spoken as a native language by approximately 6 billion people (more than 80% of
the world population), we present large-scale evidence for a statistical trade-off between the
amount of information conveyed by the ordering of words and the amount of information
conveyed by internal word structure: languages that rely more strongly on word order infor-
mation tend to rely less on word structure information and vice versa. Or put differently, if
less information is carried within the word, more information has to be spread among words
in order to communicate successfully. In addition, we find that–despite differences in the
way information is expressed–there is also evidence for a trade-off between different books
of the biblical canon that recurs with little variation across languages: the more informative
the word order of the book, the less informative its word structure and vice versa. We argue
that this might suggest that, on the one hand, languages encode information in very different
(but efficient) ways. On the other hand, content-related and stylistic features are statistically
encoded in very similar ways.","bible corpus, word order, word structure, correlational studies, "

Harvey2017,"Evaluation of hypotheses on genetic relationships depends on two factors: data-
base size and criteria on correspondence quality. For hypotheses on remote rela-

on correspondence quality is important. Hypotheses on remote relationships
commonly involve greater geographical and temporal ranges. Consequently, we
propose that there are two factors which are likely to play a greater role in com-

(i) spatial distribution of corresponding forms; and (ii) language specific unpre-
dictability in related paradigms. Concentrated spatial distributions disfavour
hypotheses of chance, and discontinuous distributions disfavour contact hypoth-
eses, whereas hypotheses of inheritance may accommodate both. Higher levels
of language-specific unpredictability favour remote over recent transmission. We
consider a remote relationship hypothesis, the Proto-Australian hypothesis. We

these two criteria, and we show that inheritance is favoured over chance and

Maiza2017,"A social network enables individuals to communicate with

community structure if the nodes of the network can be grouped into
sets of nodes such that each set is densely connected internally. The
investigation of the community structure in the social network is an
important issue in many domains and disciplines such as marketing and
bio-informatics. Community detection in social networks can be consid-

to a cluster in the graph. The goal of conventional community detection
methods is to partition a graph such that every node belongs to exactly
one cluster. However, in many social networks, nodes participate in mul-

We demonstrate the performance of the method, in comparison to existing rooting methods, by the analysis of phylogenies from eukaryotes and prokaryotes. MAD correctly recovers the known root of eukaryotes and uncovers evidence for the origin of cyanobacteria in the ocean. MAD is more robust and consistent than existing methods, provides measures of the root inference quality and is applicable to any tree with branch lengths.","rooting of phylogenetic trees, automatic approach, minimal ancestor deviation"

* The genetic code can be organised into two halves and four quarters, which manifest distinct physiochemical features.
* Codon usage bias, a phenomenon in which synonymous codons (encoding the same amino acid) are used at different frequencies in different species, is a result of complex interplays between mutation and selection.

The argument is based on a recent functional and usage-based theory of the grammar-lexicon

ideal testing ground for theories and claims about this contrast. A theoretically-based distinction

structural “heads” (e.g. Cinque 1999). Construction Grammar – as the most prominent of
the functional-cognitive theories in opposition to Chomskyan ones – focuses on the item
aspect to a degree where also templates for combination are dealt with as items (e.g. Croft

rule-governed may be seen as nothing but a stipulation (albeit a theoretically motivated

syntactic parallelism, imagistic language, and propositional language—on a tree-

Dynasty between the 7th and 9th centuries CE, these poems are often considered
the pinnacle of classical Chinese poetry. Our analysis affirms the traditional ob-

frequently parallel, especially at the phrase rather than the word level. Further, the
final couplet more often takes a non-declarative mood, uses function words, and

Greenhill2018,"What role does speaker population size play in shaping rates of language evolution?
There has been little consensus on the expected relationship between rates and
patterns of language change and speaker population size, with some predicting faster
rates of change in smaller populations, and others expecting greater change in larger
populations. The growth of comparative databases has allowed population size effects to
be investigated across a wide range of language groups, with mixed results. One recent
study of a group of Polynesian languages revealed greater rates of word gain in larger
populations and greater rates of word loss in smaller populations. However, that test was
restricted to 20 closely related languages from small Oceanic islands. Here, we test if this
pattern is a general feature of language evolution across a larger and more diverse sample
of languages from both continental and island populations. We analyzed comparative
language data for 153 pairs of closely-related sister languages from three of the world’s
largest language families: Austronesian, Indo-European, and Niger-Congo. We find some
evidence that rates of word loss are significantly greater in smaller languages for the
Indo-European comparisons, but we find no significant patterns in the other two language
families. These results suggest either that the influence of population size on rates and
patterns of language evolution is not universal, or that it is sufficiently weak that it may
be overwhelmed by other influences in some cases. Further investigation, for a greater
number of language comparisons and a wider range of language features, may determine
which of these explanations holds true.","population size, language change, lexical change, "

sulcus ( pSTS). Within the IFG, sentences engaged a more anterior portion of the area ( pars triangularis, BA 45)—compared with
phrases—which showed activity peak in BA 44. As prepositional phrases, in contrast to sentences, do not contain verbs, activity
in BA 44 may reflect structure-building syntactic processing, while the involvement of BA 45 may reflect the encoding of
propositional meaning initiated by the verb. The pSTS appears to work together with the IFG during thematic role assignment
not only at the sentential level, but also at the phrasal level. The present results suggest that merge, the process of binding words

These approaches are obvious and simple, but they lack principled justification, and yield estimates that can be wildly inaccurate. I.J. Good and Alan Turing developed a family of theoretically well‐founded techniques appropriate to this domain. Some versions of the Good‐Turing approach are very demanding computationally, but we define a version, the Simple Good‐Turing estimator, which is straightforward to use.

I will here propose that the perceived “paradox” derives from the lack of acknowledgement of certain parameters in the linguistic situation of Ancient India which were insufficiently appreciated in Renou’s time, but which are at present open to systematic exploration with the help of by now well established sociolinguistic concepts, notably the concept of “diglossia”. Three issues will here be addressed in the light of references to ancient and classical Indian texts, Sanskrit and Sanskritic. A simple genetic model is indadequate, especially when the ‘linguistic area’ applies also to what can be reconstructed for earlier periods.

Specifically, gestural verbs involving (among others) slapping and punching can be
realized as targeting the addressee (SLAP-2, PUNCH-2) if the object is second per-
son, or as targeting some other position (SLAP-a, PUNCH-a) if the object is third
person. This property is shared with ASL verbs that display object agreement. Strik-

under the focus-sensitive particle only, a behavior which is shared with phi-features
in spoken language, and is not entirely reducible to the presuppositional nature of the
marker. The main findings are based on introspective judgments, but crucial exam-

that cross-modal associations emerge depending upon which affective dimension of meaning (i.e., the
evaluation, activity, or potency dimension) is most salient in a specific context. The salience of dimensions
of meaning is assumed to depend upon the relative conceptual distances between bipolar opposed concept
pairs (e.g., good vs. bad). The dimension-specificity hypothesis proposes that plus and minus polarities will
be attributed to the bipolar concepts, and associations between concrete and affective abstract concepts
that share plus or minus polarities will become activated. Our data support the emergence of dimension-

In this paper, we present a comprehensive phylogenetic study of all species closely related to the sweet potato and address several questions pertaining to the sweet potato that remained unanswered. Our research combined genome skimming and target DNA capture to sequence whole chloroplasts and 605 single-copy nuclear regions from 199 specimens representing the sweet potato and all of its crop wild relatives (CWRs). We present strongly supported nuclear and chloroplast phylogenies demonstrating that the sweet potato had an autopolyploid origin and that Ipomoea trifida is its closest relative, confirming that no other extant species were involved in its origin. Phylogenetic analysis of nuclear and chloroplast genomes shows conflicting topologies regarding the monophyly of the sweet potato. The process of chloroplast capture explains these conflicting patterns, showing that I. trifida had a dual role in the origin of the sweet potato, first as its progenitor and second as the species with which the sweet potato introgressed so one of its lineages could capture an I. trifida chloroplast. In addition, we provide evidence that the sweet potato was present in Polynesia in pre-human times. This, together with several other examples of long-distance dispersal in Ipomoea, negates the need to invoke ancient human-mediated transport as an explanation for its presence in Polynesia. These results have important implications for understanding the origin and evolution of a major global food crop and question the existence of pre-Columbian contacts between Polynesia and the American continent.","sweet potato, linguistic evidence, linguistic palaeography"

Haspelmath2018a,"Another striking example from linguistics is the shortness of frequent words, which is
surely adaptive. But there are quite diverse paths to shortness. According to Zipf (1935),
shorter words are shorter because they underwent clipping processes (e.g. laboratory >
lab), and according to Bybee (2007: 12), short words are short because “high-frequency
words undergo reductive changes at a faster rate than low-frequency words... the major
mechanism is gradual phonetic reduction”. But actually in most cases, rarer words are
longer because they are (originally) complex elements, consisting of multiple morphs, e.g.
horse vs. hippopotamus, car vs. cabriolet, church vs. cathedral. Drastic shortening of longer
words seems to occur primarily in the modern age with its large number of technical and
bureaucratic innovations, but even here, clipping is only one of many possibilities; for
example, Ronneberger-Sibold (2014) discusses a number of fairly diverse of “shortening

Elimam2018,"Words can be matched with the concept of sign (correspondence of a signifier to a signified) as long as they act as symbol-words endowed with some semantic self-sufficiency. But in discourse, they lose their wholeness as symbol-words and metamorphose into wording-symbols. They, suddenly, appear as mere signifier entities with a more or less loose allusion to their status as cultural symbols. In discourse, words are no longer signs but tools covering ephemeral collections of neurosemes: the link of the sign breaks as soon as discourse takes over. The referential potential is no longer the schematic meaning issued from culture, but the universe of discourse under construction. This is why any attempt to account for meaning in language must integrate the neural process of meaning creation. It is now established that meaning is not the result of language activity but the result of cognition. However, what language does, via discourse, is to make this meaning communicable. For all these reasons, the task of linguistics should be to investigate the relationship between cognition and linguistic output in order to shed light on all the cognitive traces left within the surface strings. The role of morphosyntax thus has to be re-evaluated in this light.","linguistic sign, reference potential, morphosyntax, cognition, opinion paper"
Verhagen2018,"While theories on predictive processing posit that predictions are based on one’s prior experiences, experimental work has effectively ignored the fact that people differ from each other in their linguistic experiences and, consequently, in the predictions they generate. We examine usage-based variation by means of three groups of participants (recruiters, job-seekers, and people not (yet) looking for a job), two stimuli sets (word sequences characteristic of either job ads or news reports), and two experiments (a Completion task and a Voice Onset Time task). We show that differences in experiences with a particular register result in different expectations regarding word sequences characteristic of that register, thus pointing to differences in mental representations of language. Subsequently, we investigate to what extent different operationalizations of word predictability are accurate predictors of voice onset times. A measure of a participant’s own expectations proves to be a significant predictor of processing speed over and above word predictability measures based on amalgamated data. These findings point to actual individual differences and highlight the merits of going beyond amalgamated data. We thus demonstrate that is it feasible to empirically assess the variation implied in usage-based theories, and we advocate exploiting this opportunity.

This study is concerned with the identifiability of intonational phrase boundaries across familiar and unfamiliar languages. Four annotators segmented a corpus of more than three hours of spontaneous speech into intonational phrases. The corpus included narratives in their native German, but also in three languages of Indonesia unknown to them. The results show significant agreement across the whole corpus, as well as for each subcorpus. We discuss the interpretation of these results, including the hypothesis that it makes sense to distinguish between phonetic and phonological intonational phrases, and that the former are a universal characteristic of speech, allowing listeners to segment speech into intonational phrase-sized units even in unknown languages.

Hanks2018,"This chapter is set in the context of Corpus Pattern Analysis (CPA), a technique
developed by Patrick Hanks to map meaning onto word patterns found in corpora.
The main output of CPA is the Pattern Dictionary of English Verbs (PDEV), cur-
rently describing patterns for over 1,600 verbs, many of which are acknowledged to
be multiword expressions (MWEs) such as phrasal verbs or idioms. PDEV entries
are manually produced by lexicographers, based on the analysis of a substantial
sample of concordance lines from the corpus, so the construction of the resource
is very time-consuming. The motivation for the work presented in this chapter is
to speed up the discovery of these word patterns, using methods which can be
transferred to other languages. This chapter explores the benefits of a detailed con-
trastive analysis of MWEs found in English and French corpora with a view on
English-French translation. The comparative analysis is conducted through a case
study of the pair (bite, mordre), to illustrate both CPA and the application of sta-
tistical measures for the automatic extraction of MWEs. The approach taken in
this chapter takes its point of departure from the use of statistics developed ini-
tially by Church & Hanks (1989). Here we look at statistical measures which have
not yet been tested for their ability to discover new collocates, but are useful for
characterizing verbal MWEs already found. In particular we propose measures to
characterize the mean span, rigidity, diversity, and idiomaticity of a given MWE.","multiword expressions, corpus studies, linguistic annotation"

patterns of co-selection of the words actually used, rather than by simple con-

Wu2016,"Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is an end-to-end learning approach for automated translation,
with the potential to overcome many of the weaknesses of conventional phrase-based translation systems.
Unfortunately, NMT systems are known to be computationally expensive both in training and in translation
inference – sometimes prohibitively so in the case of very large data sets and large models. Several authors
have also charged that NMT systems lack robustness, particularly when input sentences contain rare words.
These issues have hindered NMT’s use in practical deployments and services, where both accuracy and
speed are essential. In this work, we present GNMT, Google’s Neural Machine Translation system, which
attempts to address many of these issues. Our model consists of a deep LSTM network with 8 encoder
and 8 decoder layers using residual connections as well as attention connections from the decoder network
to the encoder. To improve parallelism and therefore decrease training time, our attention mechanism
connects the bottom layer of the decoder to the top layer of the encoder. To accelerate the final translation
speed, we employ low-precision arithmetic during inference computations. To improve handling of rare
words, we divide words into a limited set of common sub-word units (“wordpieces”) for both input and
output. This method provides a good balance between the flexibility of “character”-delimited models and
the efficiency of “word”-delimited models, naturally handles translation of rare words, and ultimately
improves the overall accuracy of the system. Our beam search technique employs a length-normalization
procedure and uses a coverage penalty, which encourages generation of an output sentence that is most
likely to cover all the words in the source sentence. To directly optimize the translation BLEU scores,
we consider refining the models by using reinforcement learning, but we found that the improvement
in the BLEU scores did not reflect in the human evaluation. On the WMT’14 English-to-French and
English-to-German benchmarks, GNMT achieves competitive results to state-of-the-art. Using a human
side-by-side evaluation on a set of isolated simple sentences, it reduces translation errors by an average of
60% compared to Google’s phrase-based production system.","machine translation, Google, neural network, machine learning, "

Salmons2018,"Typical words in some East Asian languages, including Chinese, have reduced historically from disyllabic (CV·CV(C)) to monosyllabic (C(C)V(C)) and then open monosyllables (CV). More recently, in some of those languages, many monosyllabic CV forms again appear as disyllabic (CV·CV). The former developments result from a variety of apparently unconnected segmental changes. In the latter, they often reflect morphological innovations, like compounding and affixation. That is, apparently disparate segmental phonological processes reduced monosyllabic word templates and apparently disparate morphological and phonological processes have created new disyllables, which can all be captured in terms of preferred prosodic templates. We integrate these areal and genetic patterns into a growing literature on prosodic templates in diachrony, expanding the set of languages and patterns. That body of work has focused on sound changes that bring words into alignment with templates while our cases studies also involve clear changes in the templatic structures themselves. Finally, the patterns reviewed here resemble cycles of prosodic change, driven by tensions between reduction and minimal word constraints; we suggest that these phenomena show ‘bare’ prosodic cyclicity without the grammatical or functional ramifications of familiar cycles of change.","prosody, template phonology, Chinese, cycles of change, South-East Asian languages, sound change, "

particular in comparative linguistics. Multiple sequence alignments can be seen as a generalization of the string-
to-string edit problem to more than two strings. With the increase in the power of computational equipment, exact,
dynamic programming solutions have become feasible in practice also for 3- and 4-way alignments. For the pairwise
(2-way) case, there is a clear distinction between local and global alignments. As more sequences are considered,
this distinction, which can in fact be made independently for both ends of each sequence, gives rise to a rich set
of partially local alignment problems. So far these have remained largely unexplored. Here we introduce a general
formal framework that gives raise to a classification of partially local alignment problems. This leads to a generic scheme that guides the principled design of exact dynamic programming solutions for particular partially local
alignment problems.","multiple sequence alignment, local alignment, algorithms, "

This paper clarifies the meaning of the term ‘ontology’ in the context of
information management and the Web, and emphasizes the importance of
distinguishing between knowledge representation and knowledge
organization. It then examines how the term ‘ontology’ has been applied in
the field of linguistics, focusing on a particular kind of ontology that is
regarded as especially relevant in the context of language documentation. The
General Ontology for Linguistic Description (GOLD) is presented in some
detail, along with criticisms that have been raised against it. Finally it is
suggested that the discipline of language documentation has more need for a
knowledge organization system, and a shared thesaurus, than for an ontology-
based knowledge representation system.","ontology, introduction, definition"

documentations and lead to more efficient use of resources. It would not
necessarily improve their documentation value as such (except, possibly, in
encouraging greater consistency), but it can be claimed that the value of a

Kershenbaum2014,"Many animals produce vocal sequences that appear complex. Most researchers assume that these sequences are well characterized as Markov chains (i.e. that the probability of a particular vocal element can be calculated from the history of only a finite number of preceding elements). However, this assumption has never been explicitly tested. Furthermore, it is unclear how language could evolve in a single step from a Markovian origin, as is frequently assumed, as no intermediate forms have been found between animal communication and human language. Here, we assess whether animal taxa produce vocal sequences that are better described by Markov chains, or by non-Markovian dynamics such as the ‘renewal process’ (RP), characterized by a strong tendency to repeat elements. We examined vocal sequences of seven taxa: Bengalese finches Lonchura striata domestica, Carolina chickadees Poecile carolinensis, free-tailed bats Tadarida brasiliensis, rock hyraxes Procavia capensis, pilot whales Globicephala macrorhynchus, killer whales Orcinus orca and orangutans Pongo spp. The vocal systems of most of these species are more consistent with a non-Markovian RP than with the Markovian models traditionally assumed. Our data suggest that non-Markovian vocal sequences may be more common than Markov sequences, which must be taken into account when evaluating alternative hypotheses for the evolution of signalling complexity, and perhaps human language origins.","Markov chain, bird song, animal vocal sequence, language origin, "
Kershenbaum2014,"Paper is interesting in so far as it claims that there is an alternative process compared to simple Markov chains.

Kershenbaum2014,"Both RP and PHM models are considered non-Markovian because they do not rely on finite memory. In RP models, a particular behaviour (for instance, production of a particular vocal syllable) is repeated for some probabilistically determined time. Transitions between syllables of different types are still defined by a transition table as with a pFSA, but the number of repeats of each syllable in between transitions may be drawn from a distribution (e.g. Poisson). Although at first surprising, it can be shown that the sequence generated by such a process is non-Markovian [23] and cannot be well described by a pFSA. The RP does not fit the Markovian paradigm of finite memory, since the Poisson tail is unbounded. The PHM also relies on a nominally unbounded memory; in this case, the probability of a particular syllable occurring increases with the time since its last occurrence, and then falls to a minimum as soon as the syllable is used.","bird song, renewal process model, sequence modeling, "
Kershenbaum2014,"pFSAs remain popular for characterizing animal vocal sequences [11,14], as the mechanism for producing Markov chains is easily understood, and simple neural mechanisms for implementing them have been postulated, based on neuroanatomical observations [17,18]. However, Markov chains are insufficient for producing the complexity of any human language [9], and there exist grammatical structures that no pFSA can generate, in particular tree-like syntax such as ‘the hyrax ate the grass that grew near the rock under the tree’ [11]. Furthermore, no intermediate grammatical form exists between pFSA models and the CFG of human language [9]. It is not clear what adaptive force could drive the gradual evolution of CFGs in a species that uses only pFSA vocal communication. In computer science, the addition of register memory, which provides the ability to count the number of repetitions of a syllable, appears to be a simple transition from regular to context-free automata [19]. However, such models have not been described in animal communication.","finite state transducer, bird song, context-free grammar, CFG, "

Jelbert2018,"Cumulative cultural evolution occurs when social traditions accumulate improvements over time. In
humans cumulative cultural evolution is thought to depend on a unique suite of cognitive abilities,
including teaching, language and imitation. Tool-making New Caledonian crows show some hallmarks
of cumulative culture; but this claim is contentious, in part because these birds do not appear to imitate.
One alternative hypothesis is that crows’ tool designs could be culturally transmitted through a process
of mental template matching. That is, individuals could use or observe conspecifics’ tools, form a mental
template of a particular tool design, and then reproduce this in their own manufacture – a process
analogous to birdsong learning. Here, we provide the first evidence supporting this hypothesis, by
demonstrating that New Caledonian crows have the cognitive capacity for mental template matching.
Using a novel manufacture paradigm, crows were first trained to drop paper into a vending machine
to retrieve rewards. They later learnt that only items of a particular size (large or small templates)
were rewarded. At test, despite being rewarded at random, and with no physical templates present,
crows manufactured items that were more similar in size to previously rewarded, than unrewarded,
templates. Our results provide the first evidence that this cognitive ability may underpin the

Wang2018a,"In Mantauran (Rukai), noun+noun structures are not easy to identify as compounds or
nominal juxtapositions. According to Zeitoun (2007), these two constructions share
certain structural similarities. Linking elements such as the coordinator la ‘and’ usually do
not intervene between the two nominal constituents. They exhibit free word order and
bear independent lexical stresses. They differ in that the head of compounds cannot take
the genitive pronoun and cannot be coordinated. A more refined investigation is required
to validate Zeitoun’s (2007) analysis, however. Further pieces of morphosyntactic
evidence are provided for distinguishing compounds from nominal juxtapositions. A true
compound exhibits none of the following three properties: 1) internal genitive marking, 2)
ellipsis and 3) (multiple) modification. By contrast, nominal juxtapositions generally are
characterized by the three properties stated above. This paper also shows that Mantauran
exhibits a specific pattern in its classification of compounds. More specifically, it exhibits

an extremely broad variety of conceptual phenomena – from the most startling feats of imagination

metaphoric blends, and assesses properties that distinguish them from other blends, and lend them

relations such as cause-effect or identity, which underlie other sorts of blends. Instead they derive

Neolithic expansions from the middle Yellow River Basin and admixtures with local populations on the Tibetan Plateau who
survived the Paleolithic Age. Furthermore, according to the geographical distributions of the haplogroups, we propose that
there are two Neolithic expansion origins for all modern Tibeto-Burman populations. Our research provides a clear scenario

Wen2004,"The spread of culture and language in human populations is
explained by two alternative models: the demic diffusion model,

diffusion model, which refers to cultural impact between popu-

mechanism of the peopling of Europe has long been debated, a
key issue being whether the diffusion of agriculture and language
from the Near East was concomitant with a large movement of

the pattern of the southward expansion of Han culture is

Morrison2018,"Multiple sequence alignment is a basic procedure in molecular biology. The goal is often stated
to be to juxtapose nucleotides (or their derivatives, such as amino acids) that have been inherited
from a common ancestral nucleotide (although other goals are also possible). However, this is
not an operational definition, because homology (in this sense) refers to unique and unobservable
historical events, and so there can be no objective mathematical function to optimize.
Consequently, almost all algorithms developed for multiple sequence alignment are based on
optimizing some sort of compositional similarity (similarity = homology + analogy) . As a result,
many, if not most, practitioners either manually modify computer-produced alignments or they
perform de novo manual alignment, especially in the field of phylogenetics. So, if homology is
the goal, then multiple sequence alignment is not yet a solved computational problem. In this
review, I summarize the criteria that have been developed by biologists to help them identify
potential homologies (compositional, ontogenetic, topographical and functional similarity, plus
conjunction and congruence), and explain how these criteria can be applied to molecular data.
Current computer programs do implement one (or occasionally two) of these criteria, but no
program implements them all. What is needed is a program that evaluates all of the evidence for
the sequence homologies, optimizes their combination, and thus produces the best hypotheses of
homology. This is basically an inference problem not an optimization problem.","multiple sequence alignment, theory of alignment, methodology, sequence comparison"

accuracy of the lexicon. We test this proposal in the domain
of color naming and show that (i) color-naming systems across

observed cross-language variation; (iii) efficient IB color-naming
systems exhibit soft rather than hard category boundaries and
often leave large regions of color space inconsistently named,
both of which phenomena are found empirically; and (iv) these
IB systems evolve through a sequence of structural phase transi-
tions, in a single process that captures key ideas associated with
different accounts of color category evolution. These results sug-

its concise formulation.

Let me give a rough outline of the main ideas of this investigation,
insofar as they are of relevance to our present problem. Many

two parts in the language of science, the observational part, on the

rules of ordinary syntax (or, again, their simple symbolic counter-
parts), no problems arise as to the interpretation of the sentences
of this sublanguage.
The situation is different with regard to the theoretical sublan-
guage. Unfortunately, it is impossible, without presupposing
a considerable amount of knowledge in modern logic, to describe
in detail the logical structure of this sublanguage. A certain
loss of preciseness in the following discussion is the inevitable
result. It is hoped, however, that this loss will not seriously impair
the value of this discussion.","descriptive term, terminology, descriptive terminology, methodology"

terms designating observable properties and relations for the descrip­

other hand, contains terms which may refer to unobservable events, un­
observable aspects or features of events, e.g., to micro-particles like

Consequently, we expect that selection and drift will reduce genetic variation, which makes large amounts of gene content vari-
ation in some species so puzzling. Here, we amalgamate population genetic theory with models of horizontal gene transfer and
assert that pangenomes most easily arise in organisms with large long-term effective population sizes, as a consequence of
acquiring advantageous genes, and that the focal species has the ability to migrate to new niches. Therefore, we suggest that

listener about the location of the spider (the located object) in relation

This view on the (ir)relevance of the located object has been recently

cognate word forms after thousands of years of divergence. A wide range of clustering and clas-

level of pairwise form similarity measures have not been the main focus of research. The ap-

Elimam2017,"Words can be matched with the concept of sign (correspondence of a
signifier to a signified) as long as they act as symbol-words endowed with
some semantic self-sufficiency. But in discourse, they lose their wholeness
as symbol-words and metamorphose into w o r d i n g - s y m b o l s . They,
suddenly, appear as mere signifier entities with a more or less loose
allusion to their status as cultural symbols. In discourse, words are
no longer signs but t o o l s covering ephemeral collections of
n e u r o s e m e s : the link of the sign breaks as soon as discourse takes
over. The referential potential is no longer the schematic meaning
issued from culture, but the universe of discourse under construction.
This is why any attempt to account for meaning in language must integrate
the neural process of meaning creation. It is now established that meaning
is not the result of language activity but the result of cognition. However,
what l a n g ua g e does, via discourse, is to make this meaning
communicable. For all these reasons, the task of linguistics should be to
investigate the relationship between cognition and linguistic output in
order to shed light on all the cognitive traces left within the surface strings.

Hobolth2007,"The genealogical relationship of human, chimpanzee, and gorilla varies along the genome. We develop a hidden Markov
model (HMM) that incorporates this variation and relate the model parameters to population genetics quantities such as
speciation times and ancestral population sizes. Our HMM is an analytically tractable approximation to the coalescent
process with recombination, and in simulations we see no apparent bias in the HMM estimates. We apply the HMM to
four autosomal contiguous human–chimp–gorilla–orangutan alignments comprising a total of 1.9 million base pairs. We
find a very recent speciation time of human–chimp (4.1 6 0.4 million years), and fairly large ancestral effective
population sizes (65,000 6 30,000 for the human–chimp ancestor and 45,000 6 10,000 for the human–chimp–gorilla

also consider 250,000 base pairs of X-chromosome alignments and find an effective population size much smaller than
75% of the autosomal effective population sizes. Finally, we find that the rate of transitions between different

Sayyari2017,"Species tree reconstruction from genome-wide data is increasingly being attempted, in most cases using a two-step

this approach, which promises to account for gene tree discordance, depends on the quality of the inferred gene trees. At
the same time, phylogenomic and phylotranscriptomic analyses typically use involved bioinformatics pipelines for data
preparation. Errors and shortcomings resulting from these preprocessing steps may impact the species tree analyses at
the other end of the pipeline. In this article, we first show that the presence of fragmentary data for some species in a

Pardi2015,"Phylogenetic networks represent the evolution of organisms that have undergone reticulate
events, such as recombination, hybrid speciation or lateral gene transfer. An important way
to interpret a phylogenetic network is in terms of the trees it displays, which represent all the
possible histories of the characters carried by the organisms in the network. Interestingly,
however, different networks may display exactly the same set of trees, an observation that
poses a problem for network reconstruction: from the perspective of many inference meth-
ods such networks are indistinguishable. This is true for all methods that evaluate a phylo-
genetic network solely on the basis of how well the displayed trees fit the available data,
including all methods based on input data consisting of clades, triples, quartets, or trees
with any number of taxa, and also sequence-based approaches such as popular formalisa-
tions of maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood for networks. This identifiability prob-
lem is partially solved by accounting for branch lengths, although this merely reduces the
frequency of the problem. Here we propose that network inference methods should only at-
tempt to reconstruct what they can uniquely identify. To this end, we introduce a novel defi-
nition of what constitutes a uniquely reconstructible network. For any given set of
indistinguishable networks, we define a canonical network that, under mild assumptions, is
unique and thus representative of the entire set. Given data that underwent reticulate evolu-
tion, only the canonical form of the underlying phylogenetic network can be uniquely recon-
structed. While on the methodological side this will imply a drastic reduction of the solution
space in network inference, for the study of reticulate evolution this is a fundamental limita-

Zheng2018,"Background: We evaluated the sensitivity of the D-statistic, a parsimony-like method widely used to detect gene
flow between closely related species. This method has been applied to a variety of taxa with a wide range of
divergence times. However, its parameter space and thus its applicability to a wide taxonomic range has not been
systematically studied. Divergence time, population size, time of gene flow, distance of outgroup and number of
loci were examined in a sensitivity analysis.

Result: The sensitivity study shows that the primary determinant of the D-statistic is the relative population size, i.e.
the population size scaled by the number of generations since divergence. This is consistent with the fact that the
main confounding factor in gene flow detection is incomplete lineage sorting by diluting the signal. The sensitivity
of the D-statistic is also affected by the direction of gene flow, size and number of loci. In addition, we examined
the ability of the f-statistics, ^ f G and ^ f hom , to estimate the fraction of a genome affected by gene flow; while these
statistics are difficult to implement to practical questions in biology due to lack of knowledge of when the gene
flow happened, they can be used to compare datasets with identical or similar demographic background.

Conclusions: The D-statistic, as a method to detect gene flow, is robust against a wide range of genetic distances
(divergence times) but it is sensitive to population size. The D-statistic should only be applied with critical
reservation to taxa where population sizes are large relative to branch lengths in generations.","gene flow, D-statistic, population genetics, population size, simulation studies"

Ullrich2017,"Various complaints about the consistent use of a non-epistemological ‘norm of progress’ (also known
as ‘Scala Naturae’) can be found frequently in recent evolution of language and communication litera-

combinations of ‘high þ species’, the current account aims to go beyond the obvious in describing the
presumed phenomena. Using a mixed-methodology approach, we quantify the general use of vo-
cabulary, range of study species, amount of ‘progressionist attributes’ and subsequently qualify the
context of some key words. Investigating 915 peer-reviewed articles from a species-comparative evo-

historically regarded as ‘high’ make more use of attributes implying directed progress than otherwise.
We subdivided all articles in two distinct corpora. Articles using the term ‘language’ or ‘speech’ in title,
abstract or keywords were labelled ‘language’. Those using other terms than language were labelled
‘communication’. We could identify a more diverse focus on studied species groups and a more be-

Additionally, articles from the latter corpus tend to stress a narrative of human uniqueness. Our re-

distribution of this diversity is driven by environmental factors such as
climate or coast access. An unresolved question is whether the relevant factors

global scale. We approximate the difference between pre- versus post-
Neolithic populations by the difference between modern hunter–gatherer
versus food-producing populations. Using a novel geostatistical approach of
estimating language and language family densities, we show that
environmental—chiefly climate factors—have driven the language density
of food-producing populations considerably more strongly than the language
density of hunter–gatherer populations. Current evidence suggests that the
population dynamics of modern hunter–gatherers is very similar to that of
what can be reconstructed from the Palaeolithic record. Based on this, we cau-
tiously infer that the impact of environmental factors on language densities
underwent a substantial change with the transition to agriculture. After this
transition, the environmental impact on language diversity in food-producing
populations has remained relatively stable since it can also be detected—albeit
in slightly weaker form—in models that capture the reduced linguistic

sway, revised with every new discovery and reinterpretation. We derive a timescale of life, combining a reappraisal of the fossil

Archaebacteria, emerged much later (<​3.4 Ga), relegating the oldest fossil evidence for life to their stem lineages. The Great

It has been shown that the removal of poorly aligned regions from an alignment increases the quality of subsequent analyses. Such an alignment trimming phase is complicated in large-scale phylogenetic analyses that deal with thousands of alignments. Here, we present trimAl, a tool for automated alignment trimming, which is especially suited for large-scale phylogenetic analyses. trimAl can consider several parameters, alone or in multiple combinations, for selecting the most reliable positions in the alignment. These include the proportion of sequences with a gap, the level of amino acid similarity and, if several alignments for the same set of sequences are provided, the level of consistency across different alignments. Moreover, trimAl can automatically select the parameters to be used in each specific alignment so that the signal-to-noise ratio is optimized.

Reali2009,"Scientists studying how languages change over time often make an analogy between biological and cultural evolution, with words or grammars behaving like traits subject to natural selection. Recent work has exploited this analogy by using models of biological evolution to explain the properties of languages and other cultural artefacts. However, the mechanisms of biological and cultural evolution are very different: biological traits are passed between generations by genes, while languages and concepts are transmitted through learning. Here we show that these different mechanisms can have the same results, demonstrating that the transmission of frequency distributions over variants of linguistic forms by Bayesian learners is equivalent to the Wright–Fisher model of genetic drift. This simple learning mechanism thus provides a justification for the use of models of genetic drift in studying language evolution. In addition to providing an explicit connection between biological and cultural evolution, this allows us to define a ‘neutral’ model that indicates how languages can change in the absence of selection at the level of linguistic variants. We demonstrate that this neutral model can account for three phenomena: the s-shaped curve of language change, the distribution of word frequencies, and the relationship between word frequencies and extinction rates.","biological parallels, words, allels, simulation studies, language evolution, cultural evolution, Wright-Fischer model"

Townsend2018,"A key step in understanding the evolution of human language involves unravelling the ori-
gins of language’s syntactic structure. One approach seeks to reduce the core of syntax in
humans to a single principle of recursive combination, MERGE , for which there is no evidence
in other species. We argue for an alternative approach. We review evidence that beneath
the staggering complexity of human syntax, there is an extensive layer of nonproductive,
nonhierarchical syntax that can be fruitfully compared to animal call combinations. This is
the essential groundwork that must be explored and integrated before we can elucidate,
with sufficient precision, what exactly made it possible for human language to explode its
syntactic capacity, transitioning from simple nonproductive combinations to the unrivalled
complexity that we now have.","compositionality, language origin, Chomsky syntax, merge"
Auer2018,"In this paper, we first present a close analysis of conversational data, capturing the variety of
non-addressee deictic usages of du in contemporary German. From its beginnings, it has been possible
to use non-addressee deictic du not only for generic statements, but also for subjective utterances by a
speaker who mainly refers to his or her own experiences. We will present some thoughts on the specific
inferences leading to this interpretation, making reference to Bühler’s deixis at the phantasm. In the second
part of the paper, we show that non-addressee deictic du (‘thou’) as found in present-day German is not an
innovation but goes back at least to the 18th century. However, there is some evidence that this usage has
been spreading over the last 50 years or so. We will link non-addressee deictic du back historically to the
two types of “person-shift” for du discussed by Jakob Grimm in his 1856 article “Über den Personenwechsel
in der Rede” [On person shift in discourse]. Grimm distinguishes between person shift in formulations
of “rules and law” on the one hand, and person shift in what he calls “thou-monologue” on the other.
The subjective interpretation of non-addressee-deictic du in present-day German may have originated from
these “thou-monologues”.","second person singular, German, functional linguistics, pragmatics, "

Detges2018,"This paper deals with the question of how and why resultative constructions change into anteriors. This discussion will be based on synchronic data concerning tener + past participle, a resultative construction used in modern Spanish. One of the latter's most frequent is te lo tengo dicho 'I have (already) told you'. This is remarkable since decir 'to tell' is a non-transitional verb; te lo tengo dicho thus violates the requirement that resultatives should only combine with transitional verbs. In the literature, such mismatches between the semantics of a given construction and the meaning of its lexical filler have been claimed to normally trigger coercion, i.e. an inferential repair mechanism giving rise to special meaning effects. Thus, coercion - despite being conceived as a purely synchronic mechanism - is a prime candidate for an explanation of the change from resultative to anterior. In line with this hypothesis, occurrences of te lo tengo dicho are attested in my corpus where the latter is specified by quantifying adverbials such as muchas veces 'many times'. However, speaker judgements indiacte that even te lo tengo dicho muchas veces is not an iterative anterior construction, but still a resultative. Based on synchronic data taken from the CREA-corpus, it will be shown that in the vast majority of its occurrences, te lo tengo dicho is part of an dialogal discourse pattern where certain argumentative effects based on its resultative meaning are highly relevant. Crucially, therefore, in such ""strong"" uses a coercive shift towards an anterior meaning is excluded. On a more abstract level, it will be shown that coercion is controlled by pragmatic factors; in the case of te lo tengo dicho muchas veces, conceptual/semantic plausibility is systematically overridden by pragmatic relevance.","resultative construction, coercion, grammaticalization, Spanish, pragmatics"
SanRoque2018,"Apart from references to perception, words such as see and listen have shared, non-literal meanings across diverse languages. Such cross-linguistic meanings have not been systematically investigated as they appear in their natural home — informal spoken interaction. We present a qualitative examination of the semantic associations of perception verbs based on recorded everyday conversation in thirteen diverse languages. Across these diverse communities, spontaneous interaction provides evidence for two commonly-discussed extensions of perception verbs — perception~cognition, hearing~linguistic communication — as well as illustrating other meanings and functions (e.g., the use of perception verbs as discourse markers) that have been less appreciated heretofore. The range of usage that is readily observable in informal conversation makes it clear that this type of data must take center stage for the empirically grounded study of semantics. Moreover, these data suggest that commonalities in polysemous meanings may rely not only on universal cognition, but also on the universal exigencies of social interaction.

SanRoque2018,"To investigate transfield meanings of perception words, we began in phase one with a bottom-up approach, looking at the “free translations” provided by researchers for each example. We collapsed different grammatical forms of the same verb (e.g., the separate translations ‘think’ and ‘thinking’) as one item and grouped semantically similar items together, examining the original context where necessary to understand the meaning. The groupings were made independently by four native English speakers (the authors), with discrepancies then resolved by consensus, resulting in the groups of meanings shown in Table 1.

SanRoque2018,"In phase two, for each meaning group, researchers were asked to re-examine the one-hour sample and identify examples where a sight, hearing, and/or multi-sense term was used with one of the meanings listed in the second column of Table 1. This process confirmed the presence of candidate meanings in the data, and allowed for clearer comparison across languages, as everyone used the same criteria (and the same proxy meta-language, English) for the identification of polysemies. Researchers were also asked to identify examples of any polysemies for verbs of any sense modality that were not included in the meaning groups shown in Table 1. This ensured we did not miss less frequent sense extensions. Where there were discrepancies between “singleton” meanings identified in phases one and two, these were checked again in consultation with the relevant researcher(s).","polysemy, polysemy detection, corpus studies"

Hill2009,"The paper deals with the so-called Preference Theory developed in the works of Theo Vennemann and Robert Murray within the scope of historical phonology. The first part of the paper examines the constituting assumptions and claims of the theory. The goal of the preference-based historical phonology – uncovering the motivation for sound changes which the Neogrammarian methodology can merely describe – will be achieved only if the universal preferences are reliably established. It is shown that the procedures which are employed to extract the universal preferences from empirical data do not lead to reliable results. The reason for this is the failure of the Preference Theory to distinguish in a non-arbitrary way between the alleged universally preferred structures and the mere by-products of sound changes with different or unknown motivation. The second part of the paper examines a recently suggested modification of the traditional notion of the exceptionlessness of sound changes. According to Vennemann, the traditional exceptionless sound changes are in fact to be considered as non-exclusive tendencies towards universally more preferred phonological structures. The paper shows that this position is neither based on the core assumptions of the Preference Theory nor supported by the adduced empirical evidence.","preference theory of sound change, sound change, regular sound change, universals"

Axelsen2014,"Global linguistic diversity (LD) displays highly heterogeneous distribution patterns. Though the origin of the latter is not yet fully understood, remarkable parallelisms with biodiversity distribution suggest that environmental variables should play an essential role in their emergence. In an effort to construct a broad framework to explain world LD and to systematize the available data, we have investigated the significance of 14 variables: landscape roughness, altitude, river density, distance to lakes, seasonal maximum, average and minimum temperature, precipitation and vegetation, and population density. Landscape roughness and river density are the only two variables that universally affect LD. Overall, the considered set accounts for up to 80% of African LD, a figure that decreases for the joint Asia, Australia and the Pacific (69%), Europe (56%) and the Americas (53%). Differences among those regions can be traced down to a few variables that permit an interpretation of their current states of LD. Our processed datasets can be applied to the analysis of correlations in other similar heterogeneous patterns with a broad spatial distribution, the clearest example being biological diversity. The statistical method we have used can be understood as a tool for cross-comparison among geographical regions, including the prediction of spatial diversity in alternative scenarios or in changing environments.","river density, landscape roughness, linguistic diversity, correlational studies, Ethnologue"

MilaGarcia2018,"Within the recently-coined sub-field of corpus pragmatics, one of the areas of interest is the study of speech acts and, specifically, how it can profit from the adoption of this methodological approach. However, the acknowledged lack of correspondence between speech acts and linguistic forms makes basic form-based corpus searches unreliable in retrieving speech acts from a corpus. In fact, function-to-form corpus research can prove much more fruitful in carrying out this kind of study, but it usually requires time-consuming manual annotation, which in turn means that there have been few attempts to employ this methodology. As a contribution in this new direction, this study will showcase a function-to-form approach to investigating speech acts of agreement and disagreement in spoken Catalan. Through this example, this paper aims to show the benefits of designing, compiling, transcribing and, especially, annotating one’s own corpus for the study of speech acts. In order to annotate data for the study of speech acts, a complex and multi-layered annotation system was designed and manually applied, so that all the different aspects that play a relevant role in the expression of agreement and disagreement could be covered. In addition to discussing the findings from this study, it is argued that the possibilities of exploitation provided by the resulting annotated corpus far outweigh the time cost and open the door to in-depth analyses of speech acts and politeness in naturally occurring spoken data.","multi-layered annotation, corpus studies, corpus annotation, linguistic annotation"
DeCastroArrazola2018,"This dissertation is about verse, some of its recurrent features, and cognitive
aspects which can explain their prevalence. Verse includes a range of verbal
phenomena, most typically songs and poems, but also nursery rhymes, religious
chants or demonstration slogans. Compared to everyday speech, all these forms
show additional layers of structure, like a regular alternation of accented syllables,
a fixed melody, or a systematic number of syllables per utterance. Every linguistic
community in the world engages in verse, but certain features seem suspiciously
widespread.

On the one hand, I have developed computational tools in order to assess
systematically how widespread individual verse features are. On the other hand,
I have conducted behavioural experiments to investigate to which extent these
widespread features may stem from properties of human cognition. Using these
two approaches, the thesis examines three aspects of verse. The first part deals
with constituent structure in verse and how it can emerge in the process of iterative
learning. The second part measures final strictness in several languages, and
proposes that it is a consequence of reduced attention at the beginning of lines.
The last part develops a method to describe how linguistic and musical features are
aligned in songs, and how to test the intuitions of native speakers experimentally.
Although verse constitutes a prototypically creative activity subject to extensive
cultural variability, it is nonetheless bound and shaped by our cognitive system.

Wheeler2018,"Phylogenetic methods offer a promising advance for the historical study of language and cultural relationships. Applications
to date, however, have been hampered by traditional approaches dependent on unfalsifiable authority statements: in this regard,
historical linguistics remains in a similar position to evolutionary biology prior to the cladistic revolution. Influential phyloge-
netic studies of Bantu languages over the last two decades, which provide the foundation for multiple analyses of Bantu socio-
cultural histories, are a major case in point. Comparative analyses of basic lexica, instead of directly treating written words, use
only numerical symbols that express non-replicable authority opinion about underlying relationships. Building on a previous
study of Uto-Aztecan, here we analyse Bantu language relationships with methods deriving from DNA sequence optimization
algorithms, treating basic vocabulary as sequences of sounds. This yields finer-grained results that indicate major revisions to
the Bantu tree, and enables more robust inferences about the history of Bantu language expansion and/or migration throughout
sub-Saharan Africa. “Early-split” versus “late-split” hypotheses for East and West Bantu are tested, and overall results are com-
pared to trees based on numerical reductions of vocabulary data. Reconstruction of language histories is more empirically based
and robust than with previous methods.","Bantu languages, phylogenetic reconstruction, sequence alignment, dataset, "

Ariel2018,"Or constructions introduce a set of alternatives into the discourse. But
alternativity does not exhaust speakers’ intended messages. Speakers use the
profiled or alternatives as a starting point for expressing a variety of readings.
Ever since (Grice, H. Paul. 1989. Studies in the way of words. Cambridge, MA:
Harvard University Press) and (Horn. 1972. On the semantic properties of the
logical operators in English. Los Angeles, CA: University of California Los Angeles

lexical meaning and a predominantly exclusive use, thus focusing on two read-
ings. While another, “free choice”, reading has been added to the repertoire,
accounting for the exclusive reading remains a goal all or theorists must meet.
We here propose that both “inclusive” and “exclusive” interpretations, as cur-

with the relevance-theoretic explicature. Adopting a usage-based approach to
language, we examined all the or occurrences in the Santa Barbara Corpus of

Cognitive Linguistics, we propose that speakers’ communicated intentions are
better analyzed in terms of subjective construals, rather than the objective
conditions obtaining when the or proposition is true. We argue that in two of
these readings speakers are not necessarily committed to even one of the
alternatives being the case. In the most frequent reading, the overt disjuncts
only serve as pointers to a higher-level concept, and it is that concept that the
speaker intends to refer to.","or-construction, or sentence, pragmatics, truth value, corpus studies"

Talmy2018,"For early pre-language hominins, the vocal-auditory channel of communication as
then organized may have been unable to accommodate any enhancement in the trans-
mission of conceptual content due to three limitations: comparatively low degrees of
parameter diversity, iconicity, and fidelity. We propose that these limitations were
overcome by an evolutionary development that enabled an advance from the fixed
holophrastic calls of earlier species to the open-ended spoken language of our own
species. What developed was a “combinant” form of organization.

Such combinance is a system in which smaller units combine to form larger units.
At its smallest scale, this process yields a “clave”. In a clave, generally, units from an
inventory at a lower tier combine to form the units of an inventory at the next higher
tier in accord with a particular set of constraints. In turn, such claves function as the
smaller units that combine to form a larger unit, a concatenation, where the higher
tier of one clave serves as the lower tier of the next. The longest such concatenation
in ­language consists of six successive claves. Phonetic features combine to form pho-
nemes under the constraints of feature assembly; phonemes combine to form mor-
phemes under the constraints of phonotactics; morphemes combine to form complex
words under the constraints of morphology; morphemes and complex words combine
to form expressions under the constraints of syntax; expressions combine to form a
single speaker’s “monolog” under the constraints of discourse rules; and such monologs
combine to form an exchange between speakers under the constraints of turn-taking.

Our analysis characterizes communication at its most general and contrasts differ-
ent channels of communication. In particular, the vocal-auditory channel of spoken
language is extensively contrasted with the somatic-visual channel of signed language,
whose classifier system largely lacks the three limitations of the former. To show this
difference, the limitations are analyzed in detail (e.g., iconicity is shown to be based on six properties: prorepresentation, covariation, proportionality, proportional direct-
ness, cogranularity, and codomainality). In accord with this difference, the signed
classifier system demonstrates the cognitive feasibility of communicating advanced
conceptual content with little combinance, but the vocal-auditory channel is seen to
have needed the incorporation of combinance for spoken language to evolve.

BermudezOtero2018,"The surface realization of a linguistic expression can often be
predicted from the form of paradigmatically related items that are not con-
tained within it: in Latin, the nominative singular of a noun can often be
inferred from the genitive; in French, the final consonant of a prenominal
masculine adjective in liaison can typically be predicted from the feminine;
in Romanian, the plural form of a noun determines whether its stem will
exhibit palatalization before the derivational suffix /-ist/. Such instances of
phonological paradigmatic dependence without containment have been
claimed to challenge cyclic models of the morphosyntax-phonology interface.
In this article, however, they are shown to be established indirectly through
the acquisition of underlying representations. This approach correctly predicts
that phonological paradigmatic dependencies are never systematically
extended to new items if they involve suppletive allomorphy rather than
regular alternation, whilst those surface phonological properties of derivatives
that are under strict phonotactic control evade paradigmatic dependence on
the inflectional forms of their bases. Theories relying on surface-to-surface
computation fail to recover these empirical predictions because they are
inherently nonmodular, positing generalizations that promiscuously mix pho-

Here we sequenced and assembled the red fox genome and re-sequenced a subset of foxes from the tame, aggressive and conventional farm-bred populations to identify genomic regions associated with the response to selection for behaviour. Analysis of the re-sequenced genomes identified 103 regions with either significantly decreased heterozygosity in one of the three populations or increased divergence between the populations. A strong positional candidate gene for tame behaviour was highlighted: SorCS1, which encodes the main trafficking protein for AMPA glutamate receptors and neurexins and suggests a role for synaptic plasticity in fox domestication. Other regions identified as likely to have been under selection in foxes include genes implicated in human neurological disorders, mouse behaviour and dog domestication. The fox represents a powerful model for the genetic analysis of affiliative and aggressive behaviours that can benefit genetic studies of behaviour in dogs and other mammals, including humans.","fox, red fox, vulpes vulpes, domestication, animal evolution, symbiosis"

others. Recent work on the foundations of sound change has argued that subtle distributional facts about
segments in a language, such as functional load, play a role in facilitating or impeding change. Thus not
only are sound changes not all equally plausible, but their likelihood depends in part on phonotactics and
aspects of functional load, such as the density of minimal pairs. Tests of predictability on the chance of
phoneme merger suggest that phonemes with low functional load (as defined by minimal pair density)
are more likely to merge, but this has been investigated only for a small number of languages with very
large corpora and well attested mergers. Here we present work suggesting that the same methods can be
applied to much smaller corpora, by presenting the results of a preliminary exploration of nine Australian
languages, with a particular focus on Bardi, a Nyulnyulan language from Australia’s northwest. Our results

Background

The genetic origins of Uralic speakers from across a vast territory in the temperate zone of North Eurasia have remained elusive. Previous studies have shown contrasting proportions of Eastern and Western Eurasian ancestry in their mitochondrial and Y chromosomal gene pools. While the maternal lineages reflect by and large the geographic background of a given Uralic-speaking population, the frequency of Y chromosomes of Eastern Eurasian origin is distinctively high among European Uralic speakers. The autosomal variation of Uralic speakers, however, has not yet been studied comprehensively.

Results

Here, we present a genome-wide analysis of 15 Uralic-speaking populations which cover all main groups of the linguistic family. We show that contemporary Uralic speakers are genetically very similar to their local geographical neighbours. However, when studying relationships among geographically distant populations, we find that most of the Uralic speakers and some of their neighbours share a genetic component of possibly Siberian origin. Additionally, we show that most Uralic speakers share significantly more genomic segments identity-by-descent with each other than with geographically equidistant speakers of other languages. We find that correlated genome-wide genetic and lexical distances among Uralic speakers suggest co-dispersion of genes and languages. Yet, we do not find long-range genetic ties between Estonians and Hungarians with their linguistic sisters that would distinguish them from their non-Uralic-speaking neighbours.

Conclusions

We show that most Uralic speakers share a distinct ancestry component of likely Siberian origin, which suggests that the spread of Uralic languages involved at least some demic component.

Mahowald2018,"Zipf famously stated that, if natural language lexicons are structured for efficient communication, the words that are used the most frequently should require the least effort. This observation explains the famous finding that the most frequent words in a language tend to be short. A related prediction is that, even within words of the same length, the most frequent word forms should be the ones that are easiest to produce and understand. Using orthographics as a proxy for phonetics, we test this hypothesis using corpora of 96 languages from Wikipedia. We find that, across a variety of languages and language families and controlling for length, the most frequent forms in a language tend to be more orthographically well‐formed and have more orthographic neighbors than less frequent forms. We interpret this result as evidence that lexicons are structured by language usage pressures to facilitate efficient communication.","missing data, missing code, word frequency, word length, dataset, Wikipedia"

Dellert2018b,"Based on a recently published large-scale lexicostatistical database, we rank 1,016 con-
cepts by their suitability for inclusion in Swadesh-style lists of basic stable concepts.
For this, we define separate measures of basicness and stability. Basicness in the sense
of morphological simplicity is measured based on information content, a generaliza-
tion of word length which corrects for distorting effects of phoneme inventory sizes,
phonotactics and non-stem morphemes in dictionary forms. Stability against replace-
ment by semantic shift or borrowing is measured by sampling independent language
pairs, and correlating the distances between the forms for the concept with the overall
language distances. In order to determine the relative importance of basicness and sta-
bility, we optimize our combination of the two partial measures towards similarity with
existing lists. A comparison with and among existing rankings suggests that concept
rankings are highly data-dependent and therefore less well-grounded than previously
assumed. To explore this issue, we evaluate the robustness of our ranking against lan-
guage pair resampling, allowing us to assess how much volatility can be expected, and
showing that only about half of the concepts on a list based on our ranking can safely
be assumed to belong on the list independently of the data.","Swadesh list, concept list, ranked concept list"

tones differing only in pitch height, and with pure tone pairs differing only in interval distance.
Behaviorally, Mandarin speakers were more accurate than controls at detecting both pitch and

absent in the control group. Converging evidence from ERPs obtained during the same tasks
revealed an earlier response to change relative to no-change trials in Mandarin speakers, as well

we get the correct answer to questions if we begin with ourselves and
expand outwards, and second, whether we might fail to ask all the interesting
questions unless we combat our tendencies to favour taxa that are close to us.
As a whole, the human tendency to understand general biological phenomena
via ‘putting oneself in another organism’s shoes’ has upsides and downsides.
As an upside, our intuitive ability to rethink strategies if the situation changes
can lead to ready generation of adaptive hypotheses. Downsides occur if
we trust this intuition too much, and particular danger zones exist for traits
where humans are an unusual species. I argue that the levels of selection
debate might have proceeded differently if human cooperation patterns
were not so unique, as this brings about unique challenges in biology teaching;
and that theoretical insights regarding inbreeding avoidance versus tolerance
could have spread faster if we were not extrapolating our emotional reactions
to incest disproportionately depending on whether we study animals or
plants. I also discuss patterns such as taxonomic chauvinism, i.e. less attention
being paid to species that differ more from human-like life histories. Textbooks
on evolution reinforce such biases insofar as they present, as a default case,
systems that resemble ours in terms of life cycles and other features (e.g. gono-

Method A cross-linguistic review was undertaken of 60 articles describing 64 studies of consonant acquisition by 26,007 children from 31 countries in 27 languages: Afrikaans, Arabic, Cantonese, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Haitian Creole, Hebrew, Hungarian, Icelandic, Italian, Jamaican Creole, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Maltese, Mandarin (Putonghua), Portuguese, Setswana (Tswana), Slovenian, Spanish, Swahili, Turkish, and Xhosa.

Results Most studies were cross-sectional and examined single word production. Combining data from 27 languages, most of the world's consonants were acquired by 5;0 years;months old. By 5;0, children produced at least 93% of consonants correctly. Plosives, nasals, and nonpulmonic consonants (e.g., clicks) were acquired earlier than trills, flaps, fricatives, and affricates. Most labial, pharyngeal, and posterior lingual consonants were acquired earlier than consonants with anterior tongue placement. However, there was an interaction between place and manner where plosives and nasals produced with anterior tongue placement were acquired earlier than anterior trills, fricatives, and affricates.

Conclusions Children across the world acquire consonants at a young age. Five-year-old children have acquired most consonants within their ambient language; however, individual variability should be considered. ","age of acquisition, consonants, phoneme inventory, dataset"

work has exploited this analogy by using models of biological evolution to explain the properties of
languages and other cultural artefacts. However, the mechanisms of biological and cultural evolution are
very different: biological traits are passed between generations by genes, while languages and concepts
are transmitted through learning. Here we show that these different mechanisms can have the same results,
demonstrating that the transmission of frequency distributions over variants of linguistic forms by Bayesian
learners is equivalent to the Wright–Fisher model of genetic drift. This simple learning mechanism thus
provides a justification for the use of models of genetic drift in studying language evolution. In addition
to providing an explicit connection between biological and cultural evolution, this allows us to define a
‘neutral’ model that indicates how languages can change in the absence of selection at the level of linguistic
variants. We demonstrate that this neutral model can account for three phenomena: the s-shaped curve of
language change, the distribution of word frequencies, and the relationship between word frequencies and
extinction rates.","biological parallels, analogy, language evolution, simulation studies, s-curve"

Wilkins2014,"Charles Darwin, while trying to devise a general theory of heredity from the observations of animal and plant breeders,
discovered that domesticated mammals possess a distinctive and unusual suite of heritable traits not seen in their wild progenitors.
Some of these traits also appear in domesticated birds and fish. The origin of Darwin’s “domestication syndrome” has remained
a conundrum for more than 140 years. Most explanations focus on particular traits, while neglecting others, or on the possible selective
factors involved in domestication rather than the underlying developmental and genetic causes of these traits. Here, we propose that
the domestication syndrome results predominantly from mild neural crest cell deficits during embryonic development. Most of the
modified traits, both morphological and physiological, can be readily explained as direct consequences of such deficiencies, while other
traits are explicable as indirect consequences. We first show how the hypothesis can account for the multiple, apparently unrelated
traits of the syndrome and then explore its genetic dimensions and predictions, reviewing the available genetic evidence. The article

Kapust2018,"In prokaryotes, known mechanisms of lateral gene transfer (transformation, transduction, conjugation, and gene transfer agents)
generate new combinations of genes among chromosomes during evolution. In eukaryotes, whose host lineage is descended
from archaea, lateral gene transfer from organelles to the nucleus occurs at endosymbiotic events. Recent genome analyses
studying gene distributions have uncovered evidence for sporadic, discontinuous events of gene transfer from bacteria to archaea
during evolution. Other studies have used traditional models designed to investigate gene family size evolution (Count) to support
claims that gene transfer to archaea was continuous during evolution, rather than involving occasional periodic mass gene influx
events. Here, we show that the methodology used in analyses favoring continuous gene transfers to archaea was misapplied in
other studies and does not recover known events of single simultaneous origin for many genes followed by differential loss in real
data: plastid genomes. Using the same software and the same settings, we reanalyzed presence/absence pattern data for proteins
encoded in plastid genomes and for eukaryotic protein families acquired from plastids. Contrary to expectations under a plastid
origin model, we found that the methodology employed inferred that gene acquisitions occurred uniformly across the plant tree.
Sometimes as many as nine different acquisitions by plastid DNA were inferred for the same protein family. That is, the meth-
odology that recovered gradual and continuous lateral gene transfer among lineages for archaea obtains the same result for
plastids, even though it is known that massive gains followed by gradual differential loss is the true evolutionary process that
generated plastid gene distribution data. Our findings caution against the use of models designed to study gene family size
evolution for investigating gene transfer processes, especially when transfers involving more than one gene per event are possible.","model misspecification, problem, protein families, lateral gene transfer, methodology"

Csuroes2010,"SUMMARY:

Count is a software package for the analysis of numerical profiles on a phylogeny. It is primarily designed to deal with profiles derived from the phyletic distribution of homologous gene families, but is suited to study any other integer-valued evolutionary characters. Count performs ancestral reconstruction, and infers family- and lineage-specific characteristics along the evolutionary tree. It implements popular methods employed in gene content analysis such as Dollo and Wagner parsimony, propensity for gene loss, as well as probabilistic methods involving a phylogenetic birth-and-death model.
AVAILABILITY:

Count is available as a stand-alone Java application, as well as an application bundle for MacOS X, at the web site http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/ approximately csuros/gene_content/count.html. It can also be launched using Java Webstart from the same site. The software is distributed under a BSD-style license. Source code is available upon request from the author.

In a typical application, Φ[x] denotes the number of genes in genome x ∈ 𝒳 for a certain homolog gene family: a homolog family comprises all descendants of the same ancestral gene (Fitch, 2000) in evolutionary lineages. Such families are routinely identified by pairwise sequence comparisons, coupled with the clustering of postulated homolog pairs (Alexeyenko et al., 2006; Tatusov et al., 1997). In other interesting examples, Φ[x] might be the size (Caetano-Anollés, 2005) of genome x or a sequence length polymorphism in population x (Witmer et al., 2003).","protein families, gene families, protein evolution, "

Nichols2018,"An attractor, in complex systems theory, is any state that is more easily or more often
entered or acquired than departed or lost; attractor states therefore accumulate more
members than non-attractors, other things being equal. In the context of language
evolution, linguistic attractors include sounds, forms, and grammatical structures that
are prone to be selected when sociolinguistics and language contact make it possible
for speakers to choose between competing forms. The reasons why an element is an
attractor are linguistic (auditory salience, ease of processing, paradigm structure, etc.),
but the factors that make selection possible and propagate selected items through
the speech community are non-linguistic. This paper uses the consonants in personal
pronouns to show what makes for an attractor and how selection and diffusion work, then
presents a survey of several language families and areas showing that the derivational

and korkutmak ‘frighten, scare’, or Finnish istua ‘sit’ and istutta ‘seat (someone)’, or
Spanish sentarse ‘sit down’ and sentar ‘seat (someone)’ is susceptible to selection.
Specifically, the Turkish and Finnish pattern, where ‘seat’ is derived from ‘sit’ by addition
of a suffix—is an attractor and a favored target of selection. This selection occurs chiefly in
sociolinguistic contexts of what is defined here as linguistic symbiosis, where languages
mingle in speech, which in turn is favored by certain demographic, sociocultural, and
environmental factors here termed frontier conditions. Evidence is surveyed from northern

We attempt to gain an overview of these processes by studying the
evolutionary units in proteins, domains, in the protein sequences of 40

while a few families are very versatile in their combinatorial behaviour;
209 families do not make combinations with other families. This type of

Baluska2011,"Biological evolution represents one of the most successful, but
also controversial scientific concepts. Ever since Charles Darwin
formulated his version of evolution via natural selection,
biological sciences experienced explosive development and
progress. First of all, although Darwin could not explain how
traits of organisms, selected via natural selection, are inherited
and passed down along generations; his theory stimulated
research in this respect and resulted in the establishment of
genetics and still later in the discovery of DNA and genome
sequencing some hundred years after his evolutionary
theory. Nevertheless, there are several weaknesses in classical
Darwinian as well as Neodarwinian gene-centric views of
biological evolution. The most serious drawback is its narrow
focus: the modern evolutionary synthesis, as formulated in
the 20th Century, is based on the concept of gene and on
the mathematical/statistical analysis of populations. While
Neodarwinism is still generally considered a valid theory of
biological evolution, its narrow focus and incompatibility with
several new findings and discoveries calls for its update and/

Frandsen2015,"Background: Model selection is a vital part of most phylogenetic analyses, and accounting for the heterogeneity in
evolutionary patterns across sites is particularly important. Mixture models and partitioning are commonly used to
account for this variation, and partitioning is the most popular approach. Most current partitioning methods require
some a priori partitioning scheme to be defined, typically guided by known structural features of the sequences,
such as gene boundaries or codon positions. Recent evidence suggests that these a priori boundaries often fail to
adequately account for variation in rates and patterns of evolution among sites. Furthermore, new phylogenomic
datasets such as those assembled from ultra-conserved elements lack obvious structural features on which to define
a priori partitioning schemes. The upshot is that, for many phylogenetic datasets, partitioned models of molecular
evolution may be inadequate, thus limiting the accuracy of downstream phylogenetic analyses.

Results: We present a new algorithm that automatically selects a partitioning scheme via the iterative division of the
alignment into subsets of similar sites based on their rates of evolution. We compare this method to existing approaches
using a wide range of empirical datasets, and show that it consistently leads to large increases in the fit of partitioned
models of molecular evolution when measured using AICc and BIC scores. In doing so, we demonstrate that some
related approaches to solving this problem may have been associated with a small but important bias.

Conclusions: Our method provides an alternative to traditional approaches to partitioning, such as dividing alignments
by gene and codon position. Because our method is data-driven, it can be used to estimate partitioned models for all
types of alignments, including those that are not amenable to traditional approaches to partitioning.","partitioning, biological parallels, phylogenetic reconstruction, "

Sagart2018,"Background: Genetic data for traditional Taiwanese (Formosan) agriculture is essential for tracing the origins on
the East Asian mainland of the Austronesian language family, whose homeland is generally placed in Taiwan. Three
main models for the origins of the Taiwanese Neolithic have been proposed: origins in coastal north China (Shandong);
in coastal central China (Yangtze Valley), and in coastal south China. A combination of linguistic and agricultural
evidence helps resolve this controversial issue.
Results: We report on botanically informed linguistic fieldwork of the agricultural vocabulary of Formosan aborigines,
which converges with earlier findings in archaeology, genetics and historical linguistics to assign a lesser role for rice
than was earlier thought, and a more important one for the millets. We next present the results of an investigation of
domestication genes in a collection of traditional rice landraces maintained by the Formosan aborigines over a
hundred years ago. The genes controlling awn length, shattering, caryopsis color, plant and panicle shapes
contain the same mutated sequences as modern rice varieties everywhere else in the world, arguing against an
independent domestication in south China or Taiwan. Early and traditional Formosan agriculture was based on
foxtail millet, broomcorn millet and rice. We trace this suite of cereals to northeastern China in the period 6000–5000 BCE
and argue, following earlier proposals, that the precursors of the Austronesians, expanded south along the coast from
Shandong after c. 5000 BCE to reach northwest Taiwan in the second half of the 4th millennium BCE. This expansion
introduced to Taiwan a mixed farming, fishing and intertidal foraging subsistence strategy; domesticated foxtail millet,
broomcorn millet and japonica rice; a belief in the sacredness of foxtail millet; ritual ablation of the upper incisors in
adolescents of both sexes; domesticated dogs; and a technological package including inter alia houses, nautical
technology, and loom weaving.

Tordai2005,"Originally the term ‘protein module’ was coined to distinguish mobile

domain’, the distinction between static and mobile domains is rather vague
as it is not easy to quantify the mobility of domains. In the present work
we show that the most appropriate measure of the mobility of domains is
the number of types of local environments in which a given domain is pre-
sent. Ranking of domains with respect to this parameter in different evo-

domains to form multidomain proteins. Our analyses have also shown that
there is a correlation between domain size and domain mobility: smaller
domains are more likely to be used in the construction of multidomain pro-
teins, whereas larger domains are more likely to be static, stand-alone
domains. It is also shown that shuffling of a limited set of modules was

Ku2015,"Chloroplasts arose from cyanobacteria, mitochondria arose from proteobacteria. Both organelles have conserved their
prokaryotic biochemistry, but their genomes are reduced, and most organelle proteins are encoded in the nucleus.
Endosymbiotic theory posits that bacterial genes in eukaryotic genomes entered the eukaryotic lineage via organelle
ancestors. It predicts episodic influx of prokaryotic genes into the eukaryotic lineage, with acquisition corresponding to
endosymbiotic events. Eukaryotic genome sequences, however, increasingly implicate lateral gene transfer, both from
prokaryotes to eukaryotes and among eukaryotes, as a source of gene content variation in eukaryotic genomes, which
predicts continuous, lineage-specific acquisition of prokaryotic genes in divergent eukaryotic groups. Here we
discriminate between these two alternatives by clustering and phylogenetic analysis of eukaryotic gene families
having prokaryotic homologues. Our results indicate (1) that gene transfer from bacteria to eukaryotes is episodic, as
revealed by gene distributions, and coincides with major evolutionary transitions at the origin of chloroplasts and
mitochondria; (2) that gene inheritance in eukaryotes is vertical, as revealed by extensive topological comparison,
sparse gene distributions stemming from differential loss; and (3) that continuous, lineage-specific lateral gene
transfer, although it sometimes occurs, does not contribute to long-term gene content evolution in eukaryotic genomes.","lateral gene transfer, prokaryotic evolution, eukaryotic evolution, methodology"

While Dryer’s 659-language convenience sample does not turn up any clear example of such a construction, we argue that this is in part due to arbitrary coding choices that a priori exclude potential constructions of this type. In order to document the existence of adverbial subordinator prefixes, we present a number of languages with different genealogical and areal affiliations, each of which shows solid synchronic evidence for what appears to be a universally dispreferred feature.

Wiens2006,"Concerns about the deleterious effects of missing data may often determine which characters and taxa are included in phylogenetic analyses. For example, researchers may exclude taxa lacking data for some genes or exclude a gene lacking data in some taxa. Yet, there may be very little evidence to support these decisions. In this paper, I review the effects of missing data on phylogenetic analyses. Recent simulations suggest that highly incomplete taxa can be accurately placed in phylogenies, as long as many characters have been sampled overall. Furthermore, adding incomplete taxa can dramatically improve results in some cases by subdividing misleading long branches. Adding characters with missing data can also improve accuracy, although there is a risk of long-branch attraction in some cases. Consideration of how missing data does (or does not) affect phylogenetic analyses may allow researchers to design studies that can reconstruct large phylogenies quickly, economically, and accurately.","missing data, phylogenetic reconstruction, "
Wiens2011,"This paper will attempt to resolve some controversies about the effects of missing data on phylogenetic analysis. Whether missing data are generally problematic is a critical issue in modern phylogenetics, especially as wildly different amounts of molecular data become available for different taxa, ranging from entire genomes, to single genes, to none (e.g., fossils). Our perception of the impact of missing data (or lack thereof) may strongly influence which taxa and characters we include in a phylogenetic analysis (Wiens 2006) and may lead to a diversity of serious errors. For example, if we think that missing data are problematic when they are not, then we may exclude taxa and characters that would otherwise benefit our analyses, given the abundant evidence that increasing numbers of both taxa and characters can potentially improve the accuracy of phylogenetic analyses (e.g., Huelsenbeck 1995; Rannala et al. 1998; Poe 2003), where accuracy is generally defined as the similarity between the estimated tree and the correct, known phylogeny. In contrast, if missing data cells are themselves intrinsically problematic (e.g., Huelsenbeck 1991), including taxa or characters with many missing data cells may lead to inaccurate phylogenetic estimates.","missing data, phylogenetic reconstruction"

Blevins2016,"The modern revival of the word and paradigm model dates, for all intents and
purposes, from the publication of Hockett’s Two models of grammatical description
in 1954. This revival is something of an unintended consequence, given that
Hockett’s study is mainly an extended comparison of two variants of morphemic
analysis and, in many ways, represents the high-water mark of the morpheme-
based tradition. Bloomfield (1933) had earlier provided the foundation for models
of morphemic analysis by decomposing words into minimal units of lexical form
(morphemes) and minimal features of ‘arrangement’ (taxemes). But Bloomfield’s
proposals seemed programmatic and obscure in many respects, and it fell to his
successors to develop his approach into a general model of morphemic analysis.
The most influential line of development led to what @Hockett<1954> (1954) termed the
‘item and arrangement’ (IA) model. By reducing Bloomfield’s diverse features of
arrangement to features of ‘order’ and ‘selection’, Harris (1942) and @Hockett<1947> (1947)
arrived at a simple model in which word structure could be represented by linear
sequences of morphemes. The remaining features of arrangement were relegated
to other levels of analysis, notably to a ‘morphophonemic’ level that mediated
between sequences of morphemes and surface forms (consisting of sequences of
phonemes).","morphology, morphological theory, modeling morphology,"
Blevins2016,"The basic hierarchy, in which phrases consist of arrangements
of words, and words consist of arrangements of morphemes, had again been set out

Blevins2016,"The model that Matthews proposes is strikingly simple in its basic conception.
The paradigm of an item is represented by sets of properties (what in other
traditions are termed ‘features’), each corresponding to a cell of the paradigm. The
lexical entry of the item specifies a root or stem form on which the forms of the
paradigm are based. The realization rules of a grammar ‘interpret’ properties by
applying operations to a form. A set of such rules realize or ‘spell out’ the inflected
surface form that is associated with a paradigm cell of an item by interpreting
the properties of the cell and successively modifying the base form of the item.","word and paradigm model, morphology, morphological analysis"
Blevins2016,"The models that instantiate IA frameworks

concatenation of units.","word meaning, morphological model, morphological framework, word paradigm morphology"

acknowledging that these ‘items’ were really processes masquerading as forms,
Hockett proceeded to outline a uniformly process-based alternative. Hockett

Bloomfieldians, had previously regarded with considerable suspicion.","morphological model, item and process model, "

that apply operations other than concatenation to a base. Unlike realization rules,
processes do not ‘spell out’ previously specified features. Rather they are feature-
modifying or ‘incremental’ in the sense of Stump (2001). Just as the concatenation
of a morpheme to a base yields a unit that augments the features and form of
the base, the application of a process may alter the features and modify the form
associated with an input to which it applies. However, models that instantiate IP
frameworks are again free to specify different types of inputs (roots, stems or other
units), along with different formal operations.","morphological model, morphological framework, item and process model"

standard inflectional paradigms will not guide deductions about novel forms. Yet
other sets of word forms may still establish patterns that are of predictive value.

their own patterns of interpredictability, which in some cases are as reliable as the
expectations generated by inflectional paradigms.  Both in size and composition,
these ‘families’ show far more item-specific variation than inflectional paradigms.
Whereas inflectional paradigms are broadly uniform within a given word or
inflection class, families of derivational formations can vary in size by orders of
magnitude. The ‘lexical neighbours’ of an item may also be of deductive value, as
may be other word classes. The idea that an inflectional paradigm is the extreme
case of a predictive pattern is implicit in the way that the notion ‘paradigm’ is

this constraint is valid across languages. However, the strength at which
the constraint operates is predicted by the frequency of canonical intrinsic

Brewis2018,"Community sanitation interventions increasingly leverage presumed innate human disgust emotions and desire
for social acceptance to change hygiene norms. While often effective at reducing open defecation and en-
couraging handwashing, there are growing indications from ethnographic studies that this strategy might create
collateral damage, such as reinforcing stigmatized identities in ways that can drive social or economic mar-
ginalization. To test fundamental ethnographic propositions regarding the connections between hygiene norm
violations and stigmatized social identities, we conducted 267 interviews in four distinct global sites (in
Guatemala, Fiji, New Zealand, USA) between May 2015 and March 2016. Based on 148 initial codes applied to
23,278 interview segments, text-based analyses show that stigmatizing labels and other indices of contempt
readily and immediately attach to imagined hygiene violators in these diverse social settings. Moral concerns are
much more salient at all sites than disease/contagion ones, and hygiene violators are extended little empathy.
Contrary to statistical predictions, however, non-empathetic moral reactions to women hygiene violators are no
harsher than those of male violators. This improved evidentiary base illuminates why disgust- and shame-based
sanitation interventions can so easily create unintended social damage: hygiene norm violations and stigma-

Blevins2006,"This paper examines two contrasting perspectives on morphological analysis, and
considers inflectional patterns that bear on the choice between these alternatives. On
what is termed an ABSTRACTIVE perspective, surface word forms are regarded as basic
morphotactic units of a grammatical system, with roots, stems and exponents treated
as abstractions over a lexicon of word forms. This traditional standpoint is contrasted
with the more CONSTRUCTIVE perspective of post-Bloomfieldian models, in which
surface word forms are 'built' from sub-word units. Part of the interest of this con-
trast is that it cuts across conventional divisions of morphological models. Thus,
realization-based
models are morphosyntactically
'word-based' in the sense that they
regard words as the minimal meaningful units of a grammatical system. Yet mor-
photactically, these models tend to adopt a constructive 'root-based' or 'stem-based'
perspective. An examination of some form-class patterns in Saami, Estonian and
Georgian highlights advantages of an abstractive model, and suggests that these ad-
vantages derive from the fact that sets of words often predict other word forms and
determine a morphotactic analysis of their parts, whereas sets of sub-word units are
of limited predictive value and typically do not provide enough information to re-
cover word forms.","morphological analysis, morphological theory, word and paradigm model, "
Blevins2006,"The descriptive challenges raised by inflection classes, lexical classes and
morphomic stems illustrate different facets of a single phenomenon. In each
case, an analysis that takes a larger form as the basis for abstracting smaller
forms avoids difficulties that arise if the smaller forms are taken as the basis
for deriving the larger forms. Patterns of this sort lend a strong measure of
support to Anderson's (1992: 369) suggestion that a word-based model which
'regards the grammar as a set of relations among full surface forms ... may
merit more consideration than it has sometimes received'. The present paper
presents a sustained argument for this position.","word and paradigm model, morphological analysis, "
Majid2018,"Is there a universal hierarchy of the senses, such that some senses
(e.g., vision) are more accessible to consciousness and linguistic
description than others (e.g., smell)? The long-standing presumption
in Western thought has been that vision and audition are more
objective than the other senses, serving as the basis of knowledge
and understanding, whereas touch, taste, and smell are crude and
of little value. This predicts that humans ought to be better at
communicating about sight and hearing than the other senses, and
decades of work based on English and related languages certainly
suggests this is true. However, how well does this reflect the
diversity of languages and communities worldwide? To test
whether there is a universal hierarchy of the senses, stimuli from
the five basic senses were used to elicit descriptions in 20 diverse
languages, including 3 unrelated sign languages. We found that
languages differ fundamentally in which sensory domains they
linguistically code systematically, and how they do so. The
tendency for better coding in some domains can be explained
in part by cultural preoccupations. Although languages seem free
to elaborate specific sensory domains, some general tendencies
emerge: for example, with some exceptions, smell is poorly
coded. The surprise is that, despite the gradual phylogenetic

purposes. We created a web-based tool for annotating the articulatory features of signs (handshape, location, movement and orientation).
Videos from online dictionaries may be embedded in the tool, providing a mechanism for large-scale theoretically-informed sign
language annotation. Annotations are saved in a spreadsheet format ready for quantitative and qualitative analyses. Here, we provide
proof of concept for the utility of this tool in linguistic analysis. We used the SL adaptation of the Swadesh list (Woodward, 2000)
and applied lexicostatistic and phylogenetic methods to a sample of 23 SLs coded using the web-based tool; supplementary historic
information was gathered from the Ethnologue of World Languages and other online sources. We report results from the comparison of
all articulatory features for four Asian SLs (Chinese, Hong Kong, Taiwanese and Japanese SLs) and from the comparison of handshapes
on the entire 23 language sample. Handshape analysis of the entire sample clusters all Asian SLs together, separated from the European,
American, and Brazilian SLs in the sample, as historically expected. Within the Asian SL cluster, analyses also show, for example,
marginal relatedness between Chinese and Hong Kong SLs.","sign language, lexicostatistics, concept list, missing data, missing code"
Ranacher2017,"In linguistics, there is broad consensus that river networks have played an important role in the diffusion of languages in South America.
However, the presence of a river alone does not imply language diffusion. Languages have spread along specific routes in the network. It is
largely unknown where these routes are located, since evidence of language diffusion is often sparse and only spatially-implicit. In this paper
we propose an approach to identify probable pathways of language diffusion along the Amazon River network, combining ideas from route
planning and route inference. Route planning proposes possible routes of linguistic diffusion along the river network. Route inference tests
these against evidence from linguistic data. We find significant evidence for language diffusion along few, specific branches of the Amazon.
Our approach is not restricted to linguistic data alone. It is generally suitable to explore deep-time processes in space for which evidence is
sparse and spatially-implicit.","pathways, language diffusion, South American languages, river systems, "
Bentz2018,"There are more than 7,000 languages spoken in the world

diversification? We estimate the phylogenetic signals of geo-

Traag2018,"Community detection is often used to understand the structure of large and complex networks.
One of the most popular algorithms for uncovering community structure is the so-called Louvain
algorithm. We show that this algorithm has a major defect that largely went unnoticed until
now: the Louvain algorithm may yield arbitrarily badly connected communities. In the worst case,
communities may even be disconnected, especially when running the algorithm iteratively. In our
experimental analysis, we observe that up to 25% of the communities are badly connected and up
to 16% are disconnected. This may present serious issues in subsequent analyses. To address this
problem, we introduce the Leiden algorithm. We prove that the Leiden algorithm yields communities
that are guaranteed to be connected. In addition, we prove that, when the Leiden algorithm is
applied iteratively, it converges to a partition in which all subsets of all communities are locally
optimally assigned. Furthermore, by relying on a fast local move approach, the Leiden algorithm
runs faster than the Louvain algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the Leiden algorithm
for several benchmark and real-world networks. We find that the Leiden algorithm is faster than
the Louvain algorithm and uncovers better partitions, in addition to providing explicit guarantees.
Based on our results, we conclude that the Leiden algorithm is preferable to the Louvain algorithm.","community detection, Louvain algorithm, Leiden algorithm, graph theory, partitioning"
Villanea2018,"Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans overlapped geographically for a period of over 30,000 years following human
migration out of Africa. During this period, Neanderthals and humans interbred, as evidenced by Neanderthal portions of
the genome carried by non-African individuals today. A key observation is that the proportion of Neanderthal ancestry is
~12–20% higher in East Asian individuals relative to European individuals. Here, we explore various demographic models that
could explain this observation. These include distinguishing between a single admixture event and multiple Neanderthal con-
tributions to either population, and the hypothesis that reduced Neanderthal ancestry in modern Europeans resulted from
more recent admixture with a ghost population that lacked a Neanderthal ancestry component (the ‘dilution’ hypothesis).
To summarize the asymmetric pattern of Neanderthal allele frequencies, we compiled the joint fragment frequency spectrum
of European and East Asian Neanderthal fragments and compared it with both analytical theory and data simulated under vari-
ous models of admixture. Using maximum-likelihood and machine learning, we found that a simple model of a single admixture
did not fit the empirical data, and instead favour a model of multiple episodes of gene flow into both European and East Asian
populations. These findings indicate a longer-term, more complex interaction between humans and Neanderthals than was
previously appreciated.","Neandertal, interbreeding, human evolution, geographic models, human prehistory"

evolution of Rhinocerotids. We identified stable, unstable and pivotal traits, as well as traits
contributing to complexes, which may obey to a common developmental regulation, pointing to an
early implementation of the postcranial Bauplan among rhinocerotids. However, strikingly, most
traits are highly dissociable, used repeatedly in different combinations, in different taxa, which
usually do not form clades. Therefore, the genes encoding these traits might be recruited into novel

LaBar2016,"A major aim of evolutionary biology is to explain the respective roles of adaptive versus non-
adaptive changes in the evolution of complexity. While selection is certainly responsible for
the spread and maintenance of complex phenotypes, this does not automatically imply that
strong selection enhances the chance for the emergence of novel traits, that is, the origina-
tion of complexity. Population size is one parameter that alters the relative importance of
adaptive and non-adaptive processes: as population size decreases, selection weakens
and genetic drift grows in importance. Because of this relationship, many theories invoke a
role for population size in the evolution of complexity. Such theories are difficult to test
empirically because of the time required for the evolution of complexity in biological popula-
tions. Here, we used digital experimental evolution to test whether large or small asexual
populations tend to evolve greater complexity. We find that both small and large—but not
intermediate-sized—populations are favored to evolve larger genomes, which provides the
opportunity for subsequent increases in phenotypic complexity. However, small and large
populations followed different evolutionary paths towards these novel traits. Small popula-
tions evolved larger genomes by fixing slightly deleterious insertions, while large populations
fixed rare beneficial insertions that increased genome size. These results demonstrate that
genetic drift can lead to the evolution of complexity in small populations and that purifying
selection is not powerful enough to prevent the evolution of complexity in large populations.","complexity, evolution, simulation studies, "

The paper argues that comparative concepts are also widely used in other sciences and that they are always distinct from social categories, of which linguistic categories are special instances. Some linguists (especially in the generative tradition) assume that linguistic categories are natural kinds (like biological species or chemical elements) and thus need not be defined but can be recognized by their symptoms, which may be different in different languages. I also note that category-like comparative concepts are sometimes very similar to categories and that different languages may sometimes be described in a unitary commensurable mode, thus blurring (but not questioning) the distinction. Finally, I note that cross-linguistic claims must be interpreted as being about the phenomena of languages, not about the incommensurable systems of languages.","comparative concept, language typology, linguistic typology, methodology, terminology"

By de‐emphasizing the significance of the individual, such languages may perpetuate ancient values and norms that give primacy to the collective, inducing governments and families to invest relatively little in education because education usually increases the individual's independence from both the state and the family and may thus reduce the individual's commitment to these institutions. Carrying out both an individual‐level and a country‐level analysis, the paper indeed finds negative effects of pronoun‐drop languages. The individual‐level analysis uses data on 114,894 individuals from 75 countries over 1999‐2014. It establishes that speakers of such languages have a lower probability of having completed secondary or tertiary education, compared with speakers of languages that do not allow pronoun drop. The country‐level analysis uses data from 101 countries over 1972‐2012. Consistent with the individual‐level analysis, it finds that countries where the dominant languages permit pronoun drop have lower secondary school enrollment rates.

Wagner1996,"The problem of complex adaptations is studied in two largely disconnected research traditions: evolutionary
biology and evolutionary computer science. This paper summarizes the results from both areas and compares their
implications. In evolutionary computer science it was found that the Darwinian process of mutation, recombination
and selection is not universally effective in improving complex systems like computer programs or chip designs. For
adaptation to occur, these systems must possess ""evolvability,"" i.e., the ability of random variations to sometimes
produce improvement. It was found that evolvability critically depends on the way genetic variation maps onto
phenotypic variation, an issue known as the representation problem. The genotype-phenotype map determines the
variability of characters, which is the propensity to vary. Variability needs to be distinguished from variations, which
are the actually realized differences between individuals. The genotype-phenotype map is the common theme underlying
such varied biological phenomena as genetic canalization, developmental constraints, biological versatility, devel-
opmental dissociability, and morphological integration. For evolutionary biology the representation problem has im-
portant implications: how is it that extant species acquired a genotype-phenotype map which allows improvement by
mutation and selection? Is the genotype-phenotype map able to change in evolution? What are the selective forces,
if any, that shape the genotype-phenotype map? We propose that the genotype-phenotype map can evolve by two
main routes: epistatic mutations, or the creation of new genes. A common result for organismic design is modularity.
By modularity we mean a genotype-phenotype map in which there are few pleiotropic effects among characters serving
different functions, with pleiotropic effects falling mainly among characters that are part of a single functional complex.
Such a design is expected to improve evolvability by limiting the interference between the adaptation of different
functions. Several population genetic models are reviewed that are intended to explain the evolutionary origin of a
modular design. While our current knowledge is insufficient to assess the plausibility of these models, they form the
beginning of a framework for understanding the evolution of the genotype-phenotype map.","evolvability, phenotype, genotype, methodology, simulation studies"

Lee2016,"Can the language we speak determine how we represent the world around us? To those familiar with
the theory of linguistic relativity, this may seem like an age-old question about which everyone has
their own answer. Although the evidence supporting linguistic relativity remains controversial, the
long reach of language into our perception and behavior is nevertheless an intriguing possibility
that deserves further investigation. Here I take a closer look at a case of linguistic relativity that had a
particularly strong impact on cross-cultural research: the pronoun-drop effect. The theory of pronoun-
drop effect posits that languages that allow their speakers to drop subject pronouns in verbal commu-
nication would lead their speakers to create collectivistic culture. It was argued that the absence of
pronouns necessitates the speakers to embed their self-identities in the context of social interaction,
so the linguistic practice of omitting pronouns would reduce the sense of individuality in the minds of
speakers. After conducting a series of Bayesian multilevel analyses on the original dataset, however,
the current study concludes that the pronoun-drop effect is unlikely to be a robust, universal phenom-
enon. The analyses revealed that the majority of statistical signal supporting the phenomenon comes
from the Indo-European language family, and other families provided little or inconsistent evidence. It
was also observed that the Indo-European languages alone made up 61 per cent of the original data-
set, and dropping them from analysis completely nullified the pronoun-drop effect. These observa-
tions suggest that the pronoun-drop effect is a consequence of failing to account for (i) varying effects
among language families and (ii) overrepresentation of the Indo-European languages. With these re-

Kutsenkov2018,"Despite the increased attention to the Dogon by anthropologists and ethnologists, there are
many “white spots” in the history and ethnography of this people. For example, not so long
ago it was believed that they speak six languages; then their number grew steadily, and now
linguists number already thirty Dogon languages, conditionally united in the family of Dogon
languages of the macro-family of Niger-Congo; it is possible that there are even more of them.
The history of migrations on the Bandiagara Highlands and the adjoining plains also remains
poorly understood. All existing hypotheses, one way or another, based on oral traditions (of-
ten without specifying the informant and/or source). Only to a small extent are they based on
archaeological data. In addition to the “common Dogon” historical tradition, which states that
this people came to the Plateau around the turn of the 16 th century, there are historical legends
of individual villages, their neighbourhoods and even families. They can be very different
from the ‘general’ version. From this point of view, two oral histories of the village of Endé are
of great interest. Based on the analysis of these legends, it is possible to draw with all possible
caution a preliminary conclusion that the Dogon country was populated in two stages: the
first one falling between the 10 th and the 13 th centuries, and the second between the 15 th and
the 19 th centuries. In all examined villages exists the same model of relations between the local
population and the aliens: the new group usurps political and military power and gives the old
population its clan name, but itself adopts its language and culture. Such relations designed to
prevent possible conflicts. The article based on an analysis of the Dogon oral history collected

Raja2014,"New words are required not only to increase our vocabulary but also to create new sentences.
New words are acquired by the process of word formation which can be done in several ways. One of
the most commonly used ways to form new words is affixation either through prefixation or
suffixation. Confixation or infixation is hardly ever used and is evidenced in the Indonesian
Language. Other methods of word formation include coining, clipping, blending, acronym, and
compounding. A difficulty arises when one has to decide which morpheme comes first, if he
encounters a word with bound morphemes at both sides, since the two bound morphemes are not
simultaneously attached to the root. Confixation occurs when morphemes are bounded both ends of
the root simultaneously. Confixation can be seen in the Indonesian language.","word formation, affixation, morphology"

whether this phenomenon is the result of natural selection or a by-product of

Rockmoore2017,"We explore how ideas from infectious disease and
genetics can be used to uncover patterns of cultural
inheritance and innovation in a corpus of 591 national
constitutions spanning 1789–2008. Legal “ideas” are

network for borrowing from ancestral constitutions
back to the US Constitution of 1789 and reveal that con-
stitutions are complex cultural recombinants. We find
systematic variation in patterns of borrowing from
ancestral texts and “biological”-like behavior in patterns
of inheritance, with the distribution of “offspring” aris-
ing through a bounded preferential-attachment process.
This process leads to a small number of highly innova-

have been identified as so in the current literature. Our
findings thus shed new light on the critical nodes of

is often possible to directly observe when nodes become infected with a virus or publish the information,
observing individual transmissions (who infects whom, or who influences whom) is typically very difficult.
Furthermore, in many applications, the underlying network over which the diffusions and propagations
spread is actually unobserved. We tackle these challenges by developing a method for tracing paths of dif-
fusion and influence through networks and inferring the networks over which contagions propagate. Given
the times when nodes adopt pieces of information or become infected, we identify the optimal network that
best explains the observed infection times. Since the optimization problem is NP-hard to solve exactly, we
develop an efficient approximation algorithm that scales to large datasets and finds provably near-optimal
networks.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by tracing information diffusion in a set of 170 million
blogs and news articles over a one year period to infer how information flows through the online media

Smith2018,"There is still little agreement regarding the most important evidence for Old Chinese (OC) onset complexity—Middle Chinese (MC) mixed-onset phonetic series. This study explores a remarkable feature of this evidence first noticed by Sagart (1999). Within series such as those involving mixture of MC labials and velars with l-, x- with m-, velars with hj- (/y/), and d- with y- (/j/), MC onset and so-called A/B (syllable) Type fail to vary independently of one another. An unrecognized but inescapable implication of this association is that these MC onset results and A/B Type require a unified explanation in early Chinese. In light of the phonetic series material, I demonstrate that pre-OC Type involved two contrasting onset configurations. A number of phonetic specifications are conceivable; here, based on ideas of Ferlus (1998), I show how the data can be explained in terms of an early contrast between minor syllable forms **CǝR- (“Type A”) and tautosyllabic clusters **CR- (“Type B”) where R is a sonorant.","Old Chinese, A/B distinction, phonetic series, xiéshēng"

Arnold2012,"The lack of a widely-accepted, objectively-defined standard list of ‘basic’
meanings for use in the initial stages of the comparative method is identified
as a priority in the resolution of areas of unnecessary subjectivity in historical
and comparative linguistics. A methodology is presented, capable of ranking
meanings by a score fully representative of the four features identified as
necessary for a meaning to be considered optimal for use in the initial
stages of language comparison: maximal item stability, maximal resistance
to replacement of form by borrowing, maximal conceptual simplicity, and
maximal universality. The stability of 67 meanings is quantified using
a procedure described, but not adequately implemented, by Dolgopolsky
(1986) and Lohr (1999); the results are integrated with Tadmor et al.’s (2010)
borrowed, analyzability, and representation scores, to form a composite
score by which the meanings are ranked. The resultant ranking, while
not representative of the definitive list of meanings optimal for use in the
initial stages of the comparative method, owing to the limitation on the
number of input meanings, demonstrates the viability of the methodology
presented here. Statistical results are presented to support the hypothesis
that there is a strongly significant relationship between item stability and
variation in stability; however, contrary to expectations and conflations
evident in the literature, no evidence is found to support the hypotheses
that there are strongly significant relationships between item stability and
item borrowability, analyzability of form, or item universality. Finally, the
results are used to test the validity of the glottochronological hypothesis of
a constant rate of replacement; no support whatsoever is found to support
this hypothesis.","item stability, concept list, stability, basic vocabulary, "

level). The analytical framework is the Natural Semantic Metalanguage approach (Wierzbicka 1996, 2014,
Goddard and Wierzbicka 2014). Though ultimately resting on the foundational elements of the NSM
system, i.e. 65 semantic primes and their inherent grammar of combination, the analysis relies on
the analytical concepts of semantic molecules and semantic templates (Goddard 2012, 2016). These provide
mechanisms for encapsulating semantic complexity and for modelling relations between successive layers
of the hierarchy. Other issues considered include the extent to which cultural components feature
in the semantics of ethnozoological categories, and the extent to which semantic knowledge may vary across
different speech communities.","natural semantic metalanguage, concept list, "

Kelly2018,"West Africa is a fertile zone for the invention of new scripts. As many as twenty-seven
have been devised since the 1830s (Dalby 1967, 1968, 1969; Rovenchak, Glavy 2011, inter
alia) including one created as recently as 2010 (Ibekwe 2012, 2016). Talented individuals
with no formal literacy are likely to have invented at least three of these scripts, suggesting
that they had reverse-engineered the ‘idea of writing’ on the same pattern as the Cherokee
script, i.e. with minimal external input. Influential scholars like E. B. Tylor, A. L. Kroeber
and I. J. Gelb were to approach West African scripts as naturalistic experiments in which the
variable of explicit literacy instruction was eliminated. Thus, writing systems such as Vai and
Bamum were invoked as productive models for theorising the dynamics of cultural evolution
(Tylor [1865] 1878, Crawford 1935, Gelb [1952] 1963), the diffusion of novel technologies
(Crawford 1935, Kroeber 1940), the acquisition of literacy (Forbes 1850, Migeod 1911,
Scribner and Cole 1981) the cognitive processing of language (Kroeber 1940, Gelb [1952]
1963), and the evolution of writing itself (Crawford 1935, Gelb [1952] 1963; Dalby 1967, 2).
This paper revisits the three West African scripts that are known to have been devised by non-
literates. By comparing the linguistic, semiotic and sociohistorical contexts of each known
case I suggest various circumstances that may have favoured their invention, transmission and
diffusion. I argue that while the originators of scripts drew inspiration from known systems
such as Roman and Arabic, they are likely to have drawn on indigenous pictorial culture and
annotation systems to develop their own scripts. Once established, their creations were used
to circumscribe alternative politico-religious formations in direct opposition to the discourses
of colonial administrations. The appeal of these scripts was thus tied more to their relative
indexical power than their apparent technological or cognitive advantages. Just as earlier
theorists imagined, I contend that West African scripts do have the potential to illuminate
historical processes of creativity, transmission and evolution, but only when local
particularities are given due consideration.","writing systems, African languages"

not only have given us a much more accurate picture of the number, phylogeny, and typological
variety of the world’s languages, but they have also seen the development of a wide range of new
approaches, conceptual and technological, to the problem of documenting them. We review these
approaches and the manifold discoveries they have unearthed about the enormous variety of lin-

countries (such as the US) the call by Krauss (1992) for a significant professional realignment to-
ward language documentation has only been heeded in a few institutions. Apart from the need for
an intensified documentarist push in the face of accelerating language loss, we argue that existing
language documentation efforts need to do much more to focus on crosslinguistically comparable

for bridging the ‘transcription bottleneck’, which is creating a huge gap between the amount we

Yu2019,"From an abstract, informational perspective, protein domains ap-
pear analogous to words in natural languages in which the rules
of word association are dictated by linguistic rules, or grammar.
Such rules exist for protein domains as well, because only a small
fraction of all possible domain combinations is viable in evolution.
We employ a popular linguistic technique, n-gram analysis, to
probe the “proteome grammar”—that is, the rules of association
of domains that generate various domain architectures of pro-
teins. Comparison of the complexity measures of “protein lan-
guages” in major branches of life shows that the relative
entropy difference (information gain) between the observed do-
main architectures and random domain combinations is highly
conserved in evolution and is close to being a universal constant,
at ∼1.2 bits. Substantial deviations from this constant are ob-
served in only two major groups of organisms: a subset of Archaea
that appears to be cells simplified to the limit, and animals that
display extreme complexity. We also identify the n-grams that
represent signatures of the major branches of cellular life. The
results of this analysis bolster the analogy between genomes
and natural language and show that a “quasi-universal grammar”
underlies the evolution of domain architectures in all divisions of
cellular life. The nearly universal value of information gain by the
domain architectures could reflect the minimum complexity of sig-

Gerber2017,"The Dene-Yenisseian hypothesis (Vajda 2010a, 2013) linking the Yenisseian languages and

linguistic connection across the Bering Strait. At the same time, morphological material has
been interpreted as evidence for a genealogical relationship between Yenisseian, Burushaski

name ‘Dene-Yenisseian’ by van Driem (2014: 80) but I hereby introduce the term ‘Dene-

overarching theoretical framework that generates hypotheses across diverse domains, empirical programs spawn and grow
from personal intuitions and culturally biased folk theories. By providing ways to develop clear predictions, including through
the use of formal modelling, theoretical frameworks set expectations that determine whether a new finding is confirmatory,
nicely integrating with existing lines of research, or surprising, and therefore requiring further replication and scrutiny. Such
frameworks also prioritize certain research foci, motivate the use diverse empirical approaches and, often, provide a natural
means to integrate across the sciences. Thus, overarching theoretical frameworks pave the way toward a more general theory
of human behaviour. We illustrate one such a theoretical framework: dual inheritance theory.","big data, p-hacking, replication crisis, replicability, methodology"

of reporting confidence intervals (CIs) only in all psychological research reports. This article has
three goals. First, we correct the false impression created by Cumming that the debate about the

agree with other critics of Cumming (2014) that hypothesis testing is an important part of science

as Bayes factors, are a solution to the replicability crisis. Poor methodological practices can com-

Mukai2019,"Recursion at word-level is productive in many languages across the world, just
as it is at phrase-level (Roeper et al. 2002; Bisetto 2010). The standard
assumption is that left-branching recursive compounds (e.g. [[student film]
society]) are more productive than right-branching recursive compounds (e.g.
[student [film society]]) (Mukai 2008, 2017; Tokizaki 2011; Pöll 2015).
However, this assumption has hardly ever been tested empirically in more detail.
Using Corpus of Contemporary American English and National Web Japanese
Corpus for Japanese and native speaker’s judgements on the semantic
interpretation of the data, we found that the prediction is borne out. In other
words, recursive compounds are preferably interpreted as left-branching. After
presenting representative data from each language I will propose that left-

Schlenker2018,"ASL (American Sign Language) can express plurals by repeating a noun,
in an unpunctuated fashion, in different parts of signing space. We argue that this
construction may come with a rich (and at-issue) iconic component: the geometric
arrangement of the repetitions provides information about the arrangement of the
denoted plurality; in addition, the number and speed of the repetitions provide
information about the size of the denoted plurality. Interestingly, the shape of the
repetitions may introduce a new singular discourse referent when a vertex can be
inferred to denote a singular object. Thus one may point towards the first or last
iteration of a horizontal repetition of BOOK to denote the left- or right-edge of the
corresponding row. This yields a remarkable interaction between iconic semantics
and standard logical semantics. We show that our analysis extends to ‘punctuated’
repetitions, which involve clearly individuated iterations of a singular noun. While
these may initially look like coordinated indefinites, they are better handled by the
same iconic framework as plural, unpunctuated repetitions. Some repetition-based
mass terms also give rise to iconic effects, and to different readings depending on
whether the repetition is continuous, unpunctuated, or punctuated. Our analysis highlights the need for a formal semantics with iconicity to study the integration of
such iconic and logical conditions. It also raises a question: can similar facts be
found in spoken language when gestures are taken into account? We suggest that
several effects can be replicated, especially when one considers examples involving
‘pro-speech gestures’ (= gestures that fully replace some spoken expressions).","American Sign Language, sign language, semantics, iconicity, plural"

Konvicka2019,"A prototypical cline, following @Hopper<2003> and Traugott (2003: 7), looks as
follows:

(1) content item > grammatical word > clitic > inflectional affix

A grammaticalisation cline entails a synchronic and a diachronic perspective. In
the former case, a grammaticalisation cline represents the continuum of
expressions within a single language ranging from indisputably lexical to
indisputably grammatical. In the latter case, a grammaticalisation cline can
represent a historical development in that it illustrates the stages through which an
expression goes on its way from lexical to grammatical status.

Moreover, both the synchronic and the diachronic interpretation of a
grammaticalisation cline can be also understood typologically. Synchronically, a
cline such as (1) does not represent the possibilities in a single language, but also
across different languages. Diachronically, the development from a lexical to a
grammatical expression within one language can also be understood as a cross-
linguistic generalisation.

d. erosion (or phonetic reduction): loss of phonetic substance.","grammaticalization, grammaticalization parameters, model of grammaticalization"

Heine2019,"The ordering of these parameters reflects the diachronic sequence in which they
typically apply: grammaticalization tends to start out with extension, which triggers
desemanticization, and subsequently decategorialization, and finally erosion. Erosion is the
last parameter to come in when grammaticalization takes place, and in many of the examples
to be presented below it is not (or not yet) involved. Paradigm instances of
grammaticalization involve all four parameters but, as we will see below, there are also cases

Heine2019,"Since the paper is concerned with word formation, a note on the key concepts that will figure
below seems in order. Compounding and derivation are commonly classified as word
formation, that is, as the creation of new lexemes (e.g. @Lieber<2014> & Štekauer 2014: 3). The
former is defined by @Bauer<2003> (2003: 40) as “the formation of a new lexeme by adjoining two or
more lexemes”, cf. English football. Compounding may take on a number of quite divergent
forms and, accordingly, has been used for a range of different kinds of meaning (e.g. @Bauer<1978>
1978; @Bisetto<2005> & Scalise 2005; @Wälchli<2005> 2005; @Lieber<2009> & Štekauer 2009).","definition, compounding"
Heine2019,"Derivation shares with compounding that it belongs to word formation, and with
inflection that it typically, though not necessarily, involves affixation. But in the same way as
the distinction between compounding and derivation, that between derivation and inflection is
complex, having been portrayed as being either problematic, essentially undefinable, or even
as non-existent (see the discussions in @Bybee<1985> 1985; @Anderson<1992> 1992: 72ff.; @CarstairsMcCarthy<1992> 1992). This issue is immediately relevant to the subject matter of the present paper,

The first part of the chain of grammaticalization sketched in (4) (compounding > derivation) is well established (see Heine et al. 2016) while the second part (derivation > inflection) is far from uncontroversial, since a number of counterexamples have been identified (e.g. @Norde<2009>

Schwarzwald2019,"Two major word formation processes exist in Hebrew (in addition to minor
compounds, blends and acronyms): (a) nonlinear formation: a combination of
consonantal root with template, e.g. higdil ‘increased’ and migdal ‘tower’ are
derived from the root √gdl using the templates hiCCiC and miCCaC; (b) linear
formation: affixation to a stem, for example balšanut ‘linguistics’ from balšan
‘linguist’ + -ut, and xidon ‘quiz’ from xida ‘riddle’ + -on. The ending -on exhibits
ambiguous cases of root and template construction as opposed to suffixed word
formations. In many cases this ending is built using the nominal templates CiCaCon,
CiCCon and CaCCon, the first of which usually create abstract nouns. In other cases
-on is attached to various stems carrying the following connotations which are not
always mutually exclusive, and sometimes share some of their meanings with words
formed by the above templates: diminutive (e.g. suson ‘small horse’); collective (e.g.
še'elon ‘questionnaire’); instrumental (e.g. 'ecba'on ‘thimble’); flora and fauna (e.g.
zeron ‘harrier (bird)’); periodicals (e.g. šavu'on ‘weekly newspaper’); and division
related words (e.g. 'axuzon ‘percentile’). Thus the ending -on creates opacity as part
of a template and as a suffix for both derivational processes and meanings. One
outcome of the findings is that syllabic structure is the most important factor in
determining Hebrew word structure.","word formation, linear word formation, non-linear word formation, syntagmatic processes, paradigmatic processes"
Schwarzwald2019,"Most Hebrew words are derived from one of two major processes, linear and nonlinear (in
addition to minor compounds, blends and acronyms):

(i) 

A combination of consonantal root with vocalic template which sometimes includes
additional consonants, for example gadal ‘grew up’, higdil ‘increased’, gidel ‘raised’,
and migdal ‘tower’, all of which are derived from the root √gdl using the following
templates: CaCaC, hiCCiC, CiCeC, miCCaC. This formation is nonlinear because the
root is interwoven into the template, neither of which can be pronounced without the
other.

mašma ‘meaning’ + -i ( ADJECTIVAL suffix); balšanut ‘linguistics’ from balšan

inflection and also to certain stems for derivation. The analysis of suffixes raises the issue of
possible clashes between the two word formation processes when endings are involved.","Hebrew, word formation, non-linear word formation, linear word formation"

Rzepiela2019,"For me, particularly interesting in his concept – let us remember, based on
onomasiological presumptions and structuring lexical items according to the degree of
meaning’s abstractness and generality – is the level at which formal (morphological) and
semantic criteria meet. Dokulil (1962), as the most general term combining these criteria,
proposes word-formation category. Such a category within nouns, for example, is constituted
by names of professions. Lexemes such as decretista ‘expert in canon law’ (← decretum),
forestarius ‘forest ranger’ (← foresta), mensator ‘carpenter’ (← mensa) may be enclosed into
this category in medieval Latin. They represent the identity of semantics and WF bases (all
are desubstantive) but are coined with different suffixes. However, when derivatives [pb] characterized by semantics and WF base are, in addition, coined with the same suffix, e.g.
Lat. -tor; they are formed according to terminology used by Dokulil: WFT, as illustrated in
the Latin deverbal names of professions: braxator ‘brewer’ (← braxare ‘to brew’),
falcastrator ‘mower’ (← falcastrare ‘to mow’), impressator ‘printer’ (← impressare ‘to
print’). Moreover, to mark any slight semantic differentiation between the lexemes belonging
to the same type, it is possible to divide into further subtypes. For example, Latin nouns
using -ista to designate musicians of very strict specializations (clavichordista
‘clavichordist’, lutnista ‘lutenist’, organista ‘organist’) can be interpreted as a subtype of the
WFT of desubstantive names of professions using -ista. What is striking in this concept is
certainly its hierarchical order, which goes from the most general to the most specific term.

ReyesCenteno2016,"Genetic and fossil evidence has accumulated in support of an African origin for modern humans. Despite
this consensus, several questions remain with regard to the mode and timing of dispersal out of the
continent. Competing models differ primarily by the number of dispersals, their geographic route, and
the extent to which expanding modern humans interacted with other hominins. Central in this debate is
whether Southeast Asia was occupied significantly earlier than other parts of Eurasia and, if so, whether
the population ancestral to extant Southeast Asians was notably different from the ancestors of extant
Eurasians. Here, genetic and fossil evidence for the dispersal process out of Africa and into Asia is
reviewed. A scenario that can resolve the current archaeological, genetic, and paleontological evidence is
one which considers an initial expansion of anatomically modern humans into the Arabian Peninsula and
the Levant during the terminal Middle Pleistocene, with continued exchange with Africans until the Late
Pleistocene, when modern humans then dispersed into Eurasia in two waves. Advances in population
genomics and methods applying evolutionary theory to the fossil record will serve to further clarify
modern human origins and the out-of-Africa process.","Out-of-Africa, genetics, population geneticsnetics, "
Vihman2018,"Linguistic animacy reflects a particular construal of biological distinctions encountered in the
world, passed through cultural and cognitive filters. This study explores the process by which our construal
of animacy becomes encoded in the grammars of human languages. We ran an iterated learning experiment
investigating the effect of animacy on language transmission. Participants engaged in a simple artificial
language learning task in which they were asked to learn which affix was assigned to each noun in the
language. Though initially random, the language each participant produced at test became the language
that the subsequent participant in a chain was trained on. Results of the experiment were analysed in terms
of learnability, measured through the accuracy of responses, and structure, using an entropy measure.
We found that the learnability of languages increased over generations, as expected, but entropy did not
decrease. Languages did not become formally simpler over time. Instead, structure emerged through a
reorganisation of noun classes around animacy-based categories. The use of semantic animacy distinctions
allowed languages to retain morphological complexity while becoming more learnable. Our study shows
that grammatical reflexes of animacy distinctions can arise out of learning alone, and that structuring
grammar based on animacy can make languages more learnable.","language evolution, experimental study,  animacy hierarchy"

Sennblad2007,"Background: Evolutionary processes, such as gene family evolution or parasite-host co-
speciation, can often be viewed as a tree evolving inside another tree. Relating two given trees
under such a constraint is known as reconciling them. Adequate software tools for generating
illustrations of tree reconciliations are instrumental for presenting and communicating results and
ideas regarding these phenomena. Available visualization tools have been limited to illustrations of
the most parsimonious reconciliation. However, there exists a plethora of biologically relevant
non-parsimonious reconciliations. Illustrations of these general reconciliations may not be achieved
without manual editing.

Results: We have developed a new reconciliation viewer, primetv. It is a simple and compact
visualization program that is the first automatic tool for illustrating general tree reconciliations. It
reads reconciled trees in an extended Newick format and outputs them as tree-within-tree
illustrations in a range of graphic formats. Output attributes, such as colors and layout, can easily
be adjusted by the user. To enhance the construction of input to primetv, two helper programs,
readReconciliation and reconcile, accompany primetv. Detailed examples of all programs' usage are
provided in the text. For the casual user a web-service provides a simple user interface to all
programs.

Conclusion: With primetv, the first visualization tool for general reconciliations, illustrations of
trees-within-trees are easy to produce. Because it clarifies and accentuates an underlying structure
in a reconciled tree, e.g., the impact of a species tree on a gene-family phylogeny, it will enhance
scientific presentations as well as pedagogic illustrations in an educational setting. primetv is
available at http://prime.sbc.su.se/primetv, both as a standalone command-line tool and as a web
service. The software is distributed under the GNU General Public License.","tree viewer, software, visualization, "

Carvalho2018,"Relations between Arawakan and Guaicuruan groups in the Chaco region of South
America have been widely discussed in ethnohistorical and anthropological sources. This
paper offers the first systematic investigation of the linguistic effects of these interactions,
relying on, and contributing to, the historical study of both language families. I discuss a
number of nominal lexemes in Terena, the extant descendant of Guaná, that lack plausible
Arawakan etymologies, thus being candidates for items adopted from some non-Arawakan
language. I show that the Terena items in question are loans from Northern Guaicuruan
languages and can be traced to source forms with established Guaicuruan etymologies.
I propose some linguistic markers that characterize the Guaicuruan stratum in the Ter-

word formation and phrasal syntax obey different principles are not correct. The lexicalist hypothesis is superfluous because where there are facts that it is supposed to account for, those facts

this argument, signs of resistance to the new regime were explored. Findings show that vocal

Brunson2016,"Domestic taurine cattle (Bos taurus) were introduced to China from Central Asia between 3600 and
2000 cal BCE. Most of the earliest domestic cattle remains in China come from sacrificial or ritual con-
texts, especially in the form of oracle bones used in divination rituals. These oracle bones became closely
tied to royal authority and are the source of the earliest written inscriptions in ancient China. In this
article, we use ancient DNA to identify uninscribed bovine oracle bones from the Longshan period
archaeological sites of Taosi and Zhoujiazhuang (late third millennium BCE). We found that in addition to
making oracle bones out of domestic cattle scapulae, people also used aurochs (wild cattle: Bos pri-
migenius) scapulae for oracle bone divination. Wild water buffalo (Bubalus mephistopheles) were also
exploited at Zhoujiazhuang, but we did not identify water buffalo oracle bones in our analysis. We
propose some morphological criteria that may be useful for distinguishing between these animals, but
conclude that it is not always possible to identify bovine scapulae based on morphology alone. Our
results indicate that wild and domestic bovines were sometimes present at the same sites and their
bones were used in similar ways to make oracle bones. This raises the possibility that these species
interbred and that people in ancient China may have experimented with managing indigenous Chinese
wild bovines.","Oracle Bone inscriptions, genetics, archaelogy, "
Brzoza2018,"Lexical frequency is one of the major variables involved in language processing. It constitutes a cornerstone of psycholinguistic, corpus linguistic as well as applied research. Linguists take frequency counts from corpora and they started to take them for granted. however, voices emerge that corpora may not always provide a comprehensive picture of how frequently lexical items appear in a language. In the present contribution I compare corpus frequency counts for English and Polish words to native speaker's perception of frequency. The analysis shows that, while generally objective and subjective values are related, there is a disparity between measures for frequent Polish words. The direction of the relationship though positive, is also not as strong as in previous studies. I suggest linking objective with subjective frequency measures in research.","word frequency, corpus linguistics, Polish, English, problem, "

Arrazola2019,"Every language produces some type of verse in the form of songs, poems, or nursery rhymes, which
can be analysed as a layer of words set to a template (e.g. a tune, a poetic metre). Verse templates typ-
ically consist of hierarchically organised sections: songs are made up of stanzas, divided into lines,
containing bars, etc. We hypothesise that this kind of patterns may emerge in the process of cultural
transmission; unstructured sound sequences impose a challenge to short-term memory, but chunking
the input makes it easier to parse and reproduce the sequences accurately.
In order to test this hypothesis, we have run an iterated learning experiment where random sequen-
ces of syllables are evolved across four transmission chains with ten generations of subjects each (all
native Dutch speakers). The initial random sequences are generated by concatenating twelve tokens
of the set {ban, bi, ta, tin}, as a way to materialise the abstract verse templates without using content-
words. More precisely, the experiment aims to model the sequences of nonsense syllables used in
many traditions to communicate the rhythmic patterns underlying songs (e.g. bols in Hindustani
music, lalay patterns in Berber verse). Participants listened to the sequences of syllables, and tried to
reproduce them using four computer keys, each mapped to one of the four syllables used in the input
sequences. The relative timing of the participants’ responses were normalised so that the input al-
ways consisted of completely isochronous sequences.
Overall, the results show that sequences become shorter, easier to recall and more structured in the trans-
mission process. Some regularities can be related to a global tendency to chunk the input and increase
the popularity of a handful of ngrams. Besides, sequences increasingly tend to be opened by a heavy
syllable (e.g. ban) and closed by a light syllable (e.g. ta), which can derive from a Dutch-specific bias.","verse, poetry, transmission, iterative learning, experimental study, "

Cook2018,"The question of how best to classify Modern Standard Chinese loanwords is rather a
fraught one. Various principles of categorization have been proposed in the literature;
however, previous classification systems have generally covered only a relatively small
proportion of all loanwords currently in use. Even attempts to provide an exhaustive
catalog of lexical borrowing strategies have often been characterized by non-
transparent structure, internal inconsistency or even incompleteness. This has
hindered meaningful cross-linguistic comparisons of language change in Modern
Standard Chinese vis-à-vis other languages. The aim of this paper is to present a
new and clearly structured, comprehensive inventory of the different types of
lexical borrowing that have occurred in Modern Standard Chinese over the past
30 to 40 years. Systematic cross-linguistic comparisons reveal that examples of
almost all of the categories of lexical borrowing noted in the literature on English
language change can likewise be provided in relation to Modern Standard Chinese. In
addition, Chinese offers several options for borrowing lexical items not available to
speakers of English. Overall, this paper presents a picture of Modern Standard Chinese
speakers as cultivating a flexible, creative, playful approach to their use of language. The
explicit recognition of the fact that many so-called “alphabetic words” are established
loanwords is found to have implications for the typological classification of Chinese
script, as well as for other fields such as second language teaching. A secondary finding
not anticipated in the research question is that Chinese orthography shows tentative
early signs of potentially developing from a morpho-logographic to a phonetic writing

Karlsson2010,"The nature and origin of syntactic recursion in natural languages is a topical problem. Important recent
contributions include those of Johansson (2005), Parker (2006), Tomalin (2006; 2007), and Heine and
Kuteva (2007). Syntactic recursion will here be discussed especially in relation to its cognate concept
of iteration. Their basic common feature is plain structural repetition: “keep on emitting instances of the
current structure, or stop”. Their main difference is that recursion builds structure by increasing
embedding depth whereas iteration yields flat output structures which do not increase depth.
My focus here is on the types of recursion and iteration, and on what empirically determinable
constraints there are on the number of recursive and iterative cycles of application.
Recursion comes in two subtypes, nested recursion (= center-embedding) and tail-recursion, the
latter covering left-recursion and right-recursion. There are six functionally different types of iteration:
structural iteration, apposition, reduplication, repetition, listing and succession.
It will be empirically shown that multiple nested syntactic recursion of degrees greater than 3
does not exist in written language, neither in sentences nor in noun phrases or prepositional phrases. In
practice, even nesting of degree 2 is extremely rare in writing. In speech, nested recursion at depths
greater than 1 is practically non-existing, thus partly confirming an early hypothesis of Reich (1969).
Left-branching tail-recursion of clauses is strictly constrained to maximally two recursive cycles.
Right-branching clausal tail-recursion rarely transcends three cycles in spoken language and five in
written language. On constituent level both left- and right-branching is less constrained (especially in
written language), but e.g. left-branching genitives rarely recurse more than two cycles ([[[Pam’s]

Mesoudi2018,"In recent years, the phenomenon of cumulative cultural evolution (CCE) has
become the focus of major research interest in biology, psychology and
anthropology. Some researchers argue that CCE is unique to humans and
underlies our extraordinary evolutionary success as a species. Others
claim to have found CCE in non-human species. Yet others remain sceptical
that CCE is even important for explaining human behavioural diversity and
complexity. These debates are hampered by multiple and often ambiguous
definitions of CCE. Here, we review how researchers define, use and test
CCE. We identify a core set of criteria for CCE which are both necessary
and sufficient, and may be found in non-human species. We also identify
a set of extended criteria that are observed in human CCE but not, to
date, in other species. Different socio-cognitive mechanisms may underlie
these different criteria. We reinterpret previous theoretical models and
observational and experimental studies of both human and non-human
species in light of these more fine-grained criteria. Finally, we discuss key
issues surrounding information, fitness and cognition. We recommend that
researchers are more explicit about what components of CCE they are testing
and claiming to demonstrate.","cultural evolution, cumulative cultural evolution, introduction, overview"
Murawaki2019,"We borrow the concept of representation learning from deep learning research, and we argue that
the quest for Greenbergian implicational universals can be reformulated as the learning of good
latent representations of languages, or sequences of surface typological features. By projecting
languages into latent representations and performing inference in the latent space, we can handle
complex dependencies among features in an implicit manner. The most challenging problem in
turning the idea into a concrete computational model is the alarmingly large number of missing
values in existing typological databases. To address this problem, we keep the number of model
parameters relatively small to avoid overfitting, adopt the Bayesian learning framework for its
robustness, and exploit phylogenetically and/or spatially related languages as additional clues.
Experiments show that the proposed model recovers missing values more accurately than others
and that some latent variables exhibit phylogenetic and spatial signals comparable to those of
surface features.","structural data, machine learning, typology, "
Murawaki2018a,"A major pursuit within the study of language evolution is to advance understanding of the historical
behavior of typological features. Previous studies have identified at least three factors that deter-
mine the typological similarity of a pair of languages: (1) vertical stability, (2) horizontal diffusibility,
and (3) universality. Of these factors, the first two are of particular interest. Although observed data
are affected by all three factors to a greater or lesser degree, previous studies have not jointly mod-
eled them in a straightforward manner. Here, we propose a solution that is derived from the field of
cultural anthropology. We present a simple and extensible Bayesian autologistic model to jointly
infer the three factors from observed data. Although a large number of missing values in the data
set pose serious difficulties for statistical modeling, the proposed model can robustly estimate
these parameters as well as missing values. Applying missing value imputation to indirectly evalu-
ate the estimated parameters, we quantitatively demonstrated that they were meaningful. In con-
clusion, we briefly compare our findings with those of previous studies and discuss future
directions.","typology, structural data, machine learning,"
Ehmer2018,"Utterances usually convey more meaning than is expressed. This ‘surplus’ of meaning can be explained by
the process of inferencing. A typical definition is given, for example, by Huang, who defines inference as
the “process of accepting a statement or proposition (called the conclusion) on the basis of the (possibly
provisional) acceptance of one or more other statements or propositions (called the premises)“ (Huang
2011: 397). This definition rests on the basic distinction that there is an encoded meaning for linguistic signs
from which further meaning may be arrived at by inferences. Two types of inference can be distinguished:
semantic inference, i.e. logical entailment, and pragmatic inference. Entailment reflects logical connections
between sentences; for instance the sentence All of my friends like reading inescapably entails Some of my
friends like reading. In contrast, pragmatic inference is based on default logic, i.e. “reasoning on the basis
of stereotypes and prototypes” (Eckardt 2006: 86). For instance, in the correct context and with the correct
intonation the sentence ALL of my friends like reading might lead to the inference on part of the hearer that
she is either not considered a friend or should pick up reading as a hobby. Given that pragmatic inferences
are based on non-monotonic, i.e. probabilistic, logic, they can be canceled, whereas entailments cannot.","entailment, prototypes, probability, inference, pragmatic inference, pragmatics,"

in discontinuous semantic structures that can only be understood when the

Kastrisios2018,"Voronoi tessellation, and its dual the Delaunay triangulation, pro-
vide a cohesive framework for the study and interpretation of
phenomena of geographical space in two and three dimensions.
The planar and spherical solutions introduce errors in the posi-
tional accuracy of both Voronoi vertices and Voronoi edges due to
errors in distance computations and the path connecting two
locations with planar lines or great circle arcs instead of geodesics.
For most geospatial applications the introduction of the above
errors is insignificant or tolerable. However, for applications where
the accuracy is of utmost importance, the ellipsoidal model of the
Earth must be used. Characteristically, the introduction of any
positional error in the delimitation of maritime zones and bound-
aries results in increased maritime space for one state at the
expense of another. This is a situation that may, among others,
have a serious impact on the financial activities and the relations
of the states concerned. In the context of previous work on
maritime delimitation we show that the Voronoi diagram consti-
tutes the ideal solution for the development of an automated
methodology addressing the problem in its entirety. Due to lack
of a vector methodology for the generation of Voronoi diagram on
the ellipsoid, the aforementioned solution was constrained by the
accuracy of existing approaches. In order to fill this gap, in this
paper we deal with the inherent attributes of the ellipsoidal model
of the Earth, e.g. the fact that geodesics are open lines, and we
elaborate on a methodology for the generation of the Voronoi
diagram on the ellipsoid for a set of points in vector format. The
resulting Voronoi diagram consists of vertices with positional
accuracy that is only bounded by the user needs and edges that
are comprised of geodesics densified with vertices equidistant to
their generators. Finally, we present the implementation of the
proposed algorithm in the Python programming language and the
results of two case studies, one on the formation of closest service
areas and one on maritime boundaries delimitation, with the

filters check the output representation and decide about the legitimacy of the operation. The
two approaches are often extensionally equivalent. In this paper, I provide an argument for the
first view that is based on the hypothesis that in addition to the Merge operation that builds

words that reflect their representational fidelity. We found that grammatical category, word length, age of
acquisition, and frequency predict borrowing rates, but frequency has a non-linear relationship. Frequency
correlates negatively with probability of borrowing for high-frequency words, but positively for low-frequency
words. This borrowing evidence documents recent, observable diachronic change in the vocabulary enabling us

Hudson2019,"Language is thought to be a crucial element behind Pleistocene expansions of Homo sapiens but our understanding of language change over the very long term is still poor. There have been two main approaches to language dynamics in this context. One assumes a continual ebb and flow of local human populations and languages, leading to high levels of ‘patchiness’ in both genes and languages. Another approach argues that long-term equilibrium leads not to patchiness but to areal diffusion and convergence. Both of these approaches assume equilibrium to be the norm. However, research in ecology since the 1970s has found that ecosystems have multiple potential states rather than a single equilibrium point. Under the name of resilience theory, such thinking is being increasingly applied to coupled socio-ecological systems using the concept of the adaptive cycle. This article proposes a model of long-term language change based on the adaptive cycle of resilience theory.","resilience, ecology, resilience theory, language evolution, punctuated equilibrium model"
Hudson2019,"A number of preliminary general conclusions can be suggested from the above:

1.    Rather than a two-stage equilibrium/punctuation model as proposed by Dixon (1997), language change seems better represented by the four-stage adaptive cycle used in resilience theory.

2.    The adaptive cycle reflects actual links between languages and socio-ecological systems. The more we know about change in the latter, the better we can understand the former.

3.    Language often becomes an important element of building resilience within socio-ecological systems. Cases where languages change (‘reorganize’) slowly often reflect broader processes of resilience. Conversely, sudden language extinction or replacement can be assumed to be linked with low resilience.

4.    Linguistic theories of social selection such as Labov (1963) and LePage (1968) propose that speakers will choose from traditional or newly available speech models in order to further their social position and alliances within a particular society. The resilience approach suggests that studies of linguistic selection also need to take account of how language may work to foster socio-ecological resilience.

5.    Although the concept of ‘equilibrium’ is better understood as one phase in a dynamic cycle rather than as a static ‘baseline’, this does not necessarily rule out the concept of Sprachbund or areas of [pb] linguistic convergence. From a resilience perspective, we might expect that particular ways of doing things would diffuse outwards if they support resilience; yet very long-term resilience would also be supported by the persistence (modularity) of very different cultures, customs, and types of governance. Thus, even if they are to some extent influenced by neighbouring languages, the persistence of language isolates within a Sprachbund can normally be assumed to foster resilience.

6.    Through human history there have been several periods where language diversity has declined quite rapidly. Nettle (1999) identifies the transition from foraging to farming and the expansion of modern states and empires as two such periods of decline. The adaptive cycle approach supports this conclusion, suggesting that these are periods when previously high resilience was dramatically reduced by outside social and economic impacts. However, hunter-gatherers were perhaps the most resilient human societies ever known and they were often able to absorb a range of systemic shocks and maintain their social and linguistic functions. After the Bronze Age until around AD 1600, many hunter-gatherers were able to reorganize themselves to take advantage of previously unavailable commercial opportunities (Scott 2017). Modernization marks another phase of reorganization which is characterized by extreme linguistic standardization and reduced diversity. Although the impact of modern national languages on minority languages and dialects has been widely discussed, Culiberg (2013) shows how modern national languages were themselves created by significant reductions in diversity and thus in resilience.

7.    Finally, the resilience approach emphasizes that change is the norm and that humans are in control of only a small part of that change (Walker and Salt 2006: 28–31). A system that does not change becomes increasingly vulnerable. This is often a difficult concept to accept because ‘Most of us prefer the comfort of an accustomed life … to the adventure of dramatic change’ (Tainter 2006: 92). This question of how we view change has at least two implications here. Firstly, seeing change as normal and even desirable provides a further argument against the old idea that languages ‘decay’ from ‘purer’ prototypes. The change from Latin to Romance (Old French) has particularly been seen in such negative terms as a ‘degeneration’ involving ‘A weakening, through ignorance, through loss of tradition, and through chaotic conditions, of the norms of Classical Latin’ (Rickard 1989: 8). Although most linguists now accept that—even for Latin—change is the norm, linguists such as Banniard (2013: 64) and Culiberg (2013) have still found it necessary to critique such ideas with respect to research on Latin and Japanese, respectively. Resilience theory provides an explanation as to why some types of change do not represent a ‘degeneration’ but can in fact promote socio-ecological resilience. To use the quote from Rickard just cited, for example, a resilience approach would argue that the linguistic transition from Latin to Romance may have been a successful way to adapt to ‘chaotic conditions’ and cannot necessarily been seen as involving the simple ‘loss of tradition’. The second implication follows on from this but involves a much more difficult problem relating to the function of language. Resilience theory’s emphasis on diversity and innovation may seem inconsistent with the use of language as a highly standardized marker of social identity. Language use emphasizes conformity to the extent that ‘There is abundant experimental evidence from several societies that people are more disposed to cooperate with others who have the same dialect as themselves than those who have different dialects’ (Nettle 1999: 57). While this social marking function of language often makes it difficult for speakers to acknowledge change, the concept of the adaptive cycle provides a useful way of modelling this change, and this is an area where further research is warranted.","resilience theory, punctuated equilibrium model, language evolution"

single network. Minimum-spanning trees differ from the usual phylogenetic trees (which
are called steiner trees) in restricting all of the (internal) nodes to being from the sampled
set of taxa. That is, steiner trees allow hypothetical nodes, possibly representing
unobserved ancestors, whereas minimum-spanning trees do not. The minimum-spanning
network then has this same restriction, so that the total pathlength of a minimum-spanning
network may be greater than for the other parsimony methods (see Figure 3.25), and it will
only display the most-parsimonious trees if all of the internal nodes of the trees have been

Blasi2019,"INTRODUCTION

Human speech manifests itself in spectacular diversity, ranging from ubiquitous sounds such as “m” and “a” to the rare click consonants in some languages of southern Africa. This range is generally thought to have been fixed by biological constraints since at least the emergence of Homo sapiens. At the same time, the abundance of each sound in the languages of the world is commonly taken to depend on how easy the sound is to produce, perceive, and learn. This dependency is also regarded as fixed at the species level.

RATIONALE

Given this dependency, we expect that any change in the human apparatus for production, perception, or learning affects the probability—or even the range—of the sounds that languages have. Paleoanthropological evidence suggests that the production apparatus has undergone a fundamental change of just this kind since the Neolithic. Although humans generally start out with vertical and horizontal overlap in their bite configuration (overbite and overjet, respectively), masticatory exertion in the Paleolithic gave rise to an edge-to-edge bite after adolescence. Preservation of overbite and overjet began to persist long into adulthood only with the softer diets that started to become prevalent in the wake of agriculture and intensified food processing. We hypothesize that this post-Neolithic decline of edge-to-edge bite enabled the innovation and spread of a new class of speech sounds that is now present in nearly half of the world’s languages: labiodentals, produced by positioning the lower lip against the upper teeth, such as in “f” or “v.”

RESULTS

Biomechanical models of the speech apparatus show that labiodentals incur about 30% less muscular effort in the overbite and overjet configuration than in the edge-to-edge bite configuration. This difference is not present in similar articulations that place the upper lip, instead of the teeth, against the lower lip (as in bilabial “m,” “w,” or “p”). Our models also show that the overbite and overjet configuration reduces the incidental tooth/lip distance in bilabial articulations to 24 to 70% of their original values, inviting accidental production of labiodentals. The joint effect of a decrease in muscular effort and an increase in accidental production predicts a higher probability of labiodentals in the language of populations where overbite and overjet persist into adulthood. When the persistence of overbite and overjet in a population is approximated by the prevalence of agriculturally produced food, we find that societies described as hunter-gatherers indeed have, on average, only about one-fourth the number of labiodentals exhibited by food-producing societies, after controlling for spatial and phylogenetic correlation. When the persistence is approximated by the increase in food-processing technology over the history of one well-researched language family, Indo-European, we likewise observe a steady increase of the reconstructed probability of labiodental sounds, from a median estimate of about 3% in the proto-language (6000 to 8000 years ago) to a presence of 76% in extant languages.

CONCLUSION

Our findings reveal that the transition from prehistoric foragers to contemporary societies has had an impact on the human speech apparatus, and therefore on our species’ main mode of communication and social differentiation: spoken language.","hunter gatherers, labiodentals, uniformitarianism, farming, "

DeSmet2018,"The relation between functionally similar forms is often described in
terms of competition. This leads to the expectation that over time only one
form can survive (substitution) or each form must find its unique niche in
functional space (differentiation). However, competition cannot easily explain
what causes functional overlap or how form-function mappings will be reor-
ganized. It is argued here that the changes which competing forms undergo are
steered by various analogical forces. As a result of analogy, competing forms
often show attraction, becoming functionally more (instead of less) alike.
Attraction can maintain and increase functional overlap in language. At the
same time, competing forms are analogically anchored to a broader construc-
tional network. Cases of differentiation typically follow from the relations in
that network. Evidence is drawn from the literature and from three corpus-
based case studies, addressing attraction and differentiation in English aspec-
tual constructions, English secondary predicate constructions, and in a pair of
Dutch degree modifiers. Evidence is provided of a phenomenon competition-
based accounts could not predict (attraction), and a solution is offered for one
they could not very well explain (differentiation). More generally it is shown
that the development of competing forms must be understood against their
broader grammatical context.","attraction, competition, lexical evolution, differentiation"

over the positions first-order logic describes exactly the star-free stringsets, a strict [pb] superclass of the locally threshhold testable sets (McNaughton and Papert 1971;

Jardine2018,"It has been well established that phonological well-formedness patterns are at most
regular (Johnson 1972; Kaplan and Kay 1994; Heinz and Idsardi 2011). However, a
claim that “phonological well-formedness is regular” would be an incomplete char-
acterization. There are many regular patterns that are not attested as phonological
well-formedness patterns; for instance, “the number of ns in a word must be even”
is regular, but no such pattern has so far been discovered in natural language. 

It has
been argued, then, that more restrictive subregular (that is, star-free (SF) and weaker)
classes of stringsets are a tighter fit to the range of attested phonological patterns and
thus better characterize the nature of the computation of phonological well-formedness
(Heinz 2010a; Heinz et al. 2011; Rogers et al. 2013; McMullin and Hansson 2016).
These classes are, namely, the the strictly local (SL) stringsets (McNaughton and Papert
1971; Rogers and Pullum 2011; Rogers et al. 2013), the tier-based strictly local (TSL)
stringsets (Heinz et al. 2011), and the strictly piecewise (SP) stringsets (Rogers et al.
2010; Fu et al. 2011). These classes, which are all sub-SF, are depicted in Fig. 1. All
of these classes can be characterized by forbidden k-factor grammars over strings, and
all come with provable learning results (García et al. 1990; Heinz 2010b; Heinz and
Rogers 2013; Jardine and Heinz 2016b; Jardine and McMullin 2017). To illustrate,
the above restriction on bn in English is SL, as it can be (partially) modeled by the
forbidden substring 3-factor grammar {bn}, where  indicates the beginning of a

Koplenig2019,"Large-scale empirical evidence indicates a fascinating statistical
relationship between the estimated number of language users
and its linguistic and statistical structure. In this context, the
linguistic niche hypothesis argues that this relationship
reflects a negative selection against morphological paradigms
that are hard to learn for adults, because languages with a
large number of speakers are assumed to be typically spoken
and learned by greater proportions of adults. In this paper,
this conjecture is tested empirically for more than 2000
languages. The results question the idea of the impact of
non-native speakers on the grammatical and statistical
structure of languages, as it is demonstrated that the relative
proportion of non-native speakers does not significantly
correlate with either morphological or information-theoretic
complexity. While it thus seems that large numbers of adult
learners/speakers do not affect the (grammatical or
statistical) structure of a language, the results suggest that
there is indeed a relationship between the number of
speakers and (especially) information-theoretic complexity,
i.e. entropy rates. A potential explanation for the observed

the limitations of the most commonly employed analytical methods. In this

guide to phylogenetic path analysis using the d-separation method. We also show
how the known statistical problems associated with non-independence of data
points due to shared ancestry become compounded in path analysis. We finish with

We show that the richness of scholarship about consumption (especially around the family meal) has not been matched by research concerning the production of food and language, whereas the co-constituting circulation of food and language contributes to new meanings and values for both.

Whereas some theories provide a very poor fit with the hunter-gatherer evidence, others build their arguments around a much fuller range of the available data. The latter make a convincing case for models of human evolution that place at their center cooperative breeding and child-rearing, as well as management of conflict, flexible land tenure, and balanced gender relations.","hunter gatherers, anthropology, review, human evolution, "

Linguistic anthropologists have turned to the constitutive role of language in the formation of kin relations. People enact kin relations through behaviors that include, but are not limited to, the linguistic. Rather than static grids of terminology, linguistic anthropology finds its empirical object in the reflexive practices of speakers as they construct, reformulate, transform, and sometimes undercut cultural norms for being kin. Taking kinship behaviors that include language to be in dialectical relation to kinship structures, I review recent work that exemplifies linguistic anthropology's pragmatic approach to kinship, from the richness and diversity of kin relations to the possibility of the lack of kin relations as such.","kinship terms, anthropology, linguistics, review"

To guide our review of individual variation in the processing of phonological information, we consider studies that can illuminate broader issues in the field, such as the nature of linguistic representations and processes. We also consider how the study of individual differences can provide insight into long-standing issues in linguistic variation and change. Since linguistic communities are made up of individuals, the questions raised by examining individual differences in linguistic processing are relevant to those who study all aspects of language.","language processing, phonology, individuals, heterogeneity"

Some investigators have failed to find evidence of a bilingual advantage; others have suggested that bilingual advantages may be entirely spurious, while proponents of the advantage case have continued to defend it. A heated debate has ensued, and the field has now reached an impasse.

Nazzi2019,"All languages instantiate a consonant/vowel contrast. This contrast has processing consequences at different levels of spoken-language recognition throughout the lifespan. In adulthood, lexical processing is more strongly associated with consonant than with vowel processing; this has been demonstrated across 13 languages from seven language families and in a variety of auditory lexical-level tasks (deciding whether a spoken input is a word, spotting a real word embedded in a minimal context, reconstructing a word minimally altered into a pseudoword, learning new words or the “words” of a made-up language), as well as in written-word tasks involving phonological processing. In infancy, a consonant advantage in word learning and recognition is found to emerge during development in some languages, though possibly not in others, revealing that the stronger lexicon–consonant association found in adulthood is learned. Current research is evaluating the relative contribution of the early acquisition of the acoustic/phonetic and lexical properties of the native language in the emergence of this association.","speech recognition, consonants, vowels, spoken language, pseudo word"

that Ancient Egyptian-Coptic undergoes a long-term diachronic macro-
change from exhibiting mixed suffixing-prefixing to showing an over-

comparison of ten typologically significant parameters in which prefixing or
affixing is potentially at stake, based on Dryer’s (2013a) 969-language sam-
ple. With its extremely high prefixing preference, Coptic belongs to the rare
6% or so of languages that are predominantly prefixing. We argue that each
of the micro-changes implicated in this macro-change are better understood

terms of a broad structural “drift.” Crucially, there is nothing unusual about
the actual processes of change themselves.","affixation, Egypt, word formation, universals"

distinct and named varieties, many of which are mutually intelligible but many of which are not. In
Myanmar, the Tangsa sub-tribes are grouped under Tangshang Naga.
This paper examines and exemplifies the phenomneon of verb stem alternation, whereby a single verb has
two stems, a verbal stem, which is demonstrated to be the ‘base’ or underived form, and a nominal stem
which has different form, most frequently a different tone category.
As with other Tibeto-Burman languages, both the forms and the functions of the stem alternations in the
Tangsa varieties show considerable diversity. In the Tangsa varieties treated here, one of the stems,
which we term the verbal form, is clearly the underived root and the alternate stem is derived from it. The
most frequent way of forming an alternate stem is a change of tone category, keeping the vowel and any
final consonants the same. In multiple cases in one Tangsa variety there is an alternate stem carrying a
different form, and in a related variety there is no alternation between the stems.
The verbal and nominal stems for 151 roots in the Mueshaung and Ngaimong varieties will be compared,

two languages by considering their overlap, i.e., the percentage of cognates. The overlap was
estimated by comparing two ad hoc lists with words corresponding to same meanings for the two
languages. The notable assumption of Swadesh was that replacements in a vocabulary occur at
a universal constant rate so that the time distance from the eventual common ancestor can be
determined. In his view only replacements are relevant while horizontal transfers (borrowings from
other languages) are less important and their effect can be eventually taken into account assuming
that the divergence is diminished by contact. Later, the mainstream of glottochronology adopted
the point of view that the effect of loanwords could be eliminated by careful work devoted to
their identification so that they would not affect any measure of distance between languages. The
aim of this paper is to show by experimental evidence that horizontal transfers, on the contrary,
are a primary aspect of languages evolution since their effect on the vocabulary is at least as
important as that of spontaneous replacements. We finally show that this phenomenon severely
and unavoidably limits the possibility to fully reconstruct a proto-language. This limitation is
fundamental, i.e., it gives a bound which cannot be infringed, independently of the method used
for the reconstruction.","Romance, glottochronology, statistics, borrowing, language contact"

find ordinary cognition. Like other ‘cognitive linguists’, I believe that language
is very similar to other kinds of thinking. I also believe that the fine details that
we linguists find when looking at language tell us a great deal not only about lan-
guage, but also about how we think in general. Every single phenomenon that I
know about, as a linguist, is just as you’d expect given the way in which (accord-
ing to Part I) the mind works.

Finally, Part III, ‘How English works’, gives a brief survey of English grammar.
The chapter on syntax summarizes my little 1998 textbook English Grammar
which supported my first-year undergraduate course on English grammar. The
students seemed to enjoy learning to draw dependency arrows and appreciated the
idea that this was a skill that they could apply to virtually any English sentence.

Dingemanse2018,"Ideophones (also known as expressives or mimetics, and including onomatopoeia) have been
systematically studied in linguistics since the 1850s, when they were first described as a lexical
class of vivid sensory words in West-African languages. This paper surveys the research history
of ideophones, from its roots in African linguistics to its fruits in general linguistics and typology
around the globe. It shows that despite a recurrent narrative of marginalisation, work on
ideophones has made an impact in many areas of linguistics, from theories of phonological
features to typologies of manner and motion, and from sound symbolism to sensory language.
Due to their hybrid nature as gradient vocal gestures that grow roots in discrete linguistic
systems, ideophones provide opportunities to reframe typological questions, reconsider the
role of language ideology in linguistic scholarship, and rethink the margins of language. With
ideophones increasingly being brought into the fold of the language sciences, this review
synthesises past theoretical insights and empirical findings in order to enable future work to
build on them.","ideophones, sound symbolism, "

Miller1998,"THIS book has taken longer to write than we expected. It began as an
account of the syntactic structures and discourse devices to be found in
spontaneous spoken language. It gradually developed into a comparison of
syntax and discourse in spontaneous spoken English, Russian, and
German. One motive was to make linguists in English-speaking countries
aware of the work that has been carried out elsewhere; another motive was
to gather cross-language evidence to support the view that we were dealing
with regular structures and not with performance errors. The book also
developed into an attempt to demonstrate that the growing body of
analyses of spontaneous spoken language was relevant to a number of
areas in theoretical linguistics: received views of constructions in particular
languages, to theories of the on-line processing of spoken language by
humans, to theoretical work in typology, and, perhaps most crucially, to
theories of first language acquisition.

Miller1998,"The central thesis of the book is that the syntactic structure of phrases
and clauses in spontaneous spoken language is very different from the
structure of phrases and clauses in written language. The differences reside
in the complexity of such constructions—what is meant by complexity will
be explained in Chapters 3 and 4—and in the types of constructions. There
are many types of phrase and clause construction that occur frequently in
writing but very rarely in speech and other types that occur frequently in
speech but never in writing. A secondary thesis, which forms the subject
matter of Chapters 5 and 6, is that the organization of spontaneous spoken
discourse is very different from the organization of written discourse, and
has its own discourse-organizing devices.","spontaneous spoken language, complexity, "

Coelho2019,"Although many hypotheses have been proposed to explain why humans
speak so many languages and why languages are unevenly distributed
across the globe, the factors that shape geographical patterns of cultural
and linguistic diversity remain poorly understood. Prior research has
tended to focus on identifying universal predictors of language diversity,
without accounting for how local factors and multiple predictors interact.
Here, we use a unique combination of path analysis, mechanistic simulation
modelling, and geographically weighted regression to investigate the
broadly described, but poorly understood, spatial pattern of language diver-
sity in North America. We show that the ecological drivers of language
diversity are not universal or entirely direct. The strongest associations
imply a role for previously developed hypothesized drivers such as popu-
lation density, resource diversity, and carrying capacity with group size
limits. The predictive power of this web of factors varies over space from
regions where our model predicts approximately 86% of the variation in
diversity, to areas where less than 40% is explained.","linguistic diversity, model, modeling, simulation studies, correlational studies, "

piece of evidence available to the hearer of the speaker’s meaning. After critically evaluating examples
from previous studies and my own examples, the study concludes that discourse comprehension is a
sequential and graded process. To understand the significance of LM as evidence in the process of
meaning understanding, the study has to reconsider the notion of evidence according to Relevance
Theory (RT) and define the vigorously debated term of LM. The results from this study suggest that
literal meaning is initial and context is subsequential; while both co-determine the speaker’s meaning in
implicature, the latter enriches the speaker’s meaning into a higher order speech act in explicature.","semantics, literal meaning, "

performance, educational choices and post-graduation migration in a setting of quasi-
random assignment to undergraduate seminars at a British university. We focus on two core
variables: the share of non-English-speaking students and the diversity within the group of
non-English-speaking students with respect to their linguistic background. English-speaking
students are largely unaffected by the ethno-linguistic classroom composition. Non-English-
speaking students benefit from a larger diversity in their performance and increase their
interaction with English-speaking students. Educational choices of non-English-speaking
students become more similar to choices of English-speaking students in response to more
diverse classes. Post-graduation, non-English students who have been assigned to higher
shares of non-English students in the compulsory stage are more likely to leave the country.

education. Avoiding segregation along ethnic lines is key in providing education for an

of cladogenetic changes, or whether evolution tends to be of a more gradual, anagenetic nature. A similar discussion among
linguists has barely begun, but the present results suggest that there is also room for controversy over this issue in linguistics.
The only previous study correlated the number of nodes in linguistic phylogenies with branch lengths and found support
for punctuated equilibrium. We replicate this result for branch lengths, but find no support for punctuated equilibrium
using a different, automated measure of linguistic divergence and a much larger data set. With the automated measure,
segments of trees containing more nodes show no greater divergence from an outgroup than segments containing fewer
nodes.","simulation studies, punctuational change, ASJP, "

Kleinert2009,"The article deals with two widespread mistakes concerning Galileo: A false quotation and a translation
error. The quotation reads as follows: “Measure what is measurable, and make measurable what is not
so.” Although Galileo is quoted with these words in a large number of publications, the authenticity of
the sentence is highly dubious because no one has ever provided a precise bibliographical reference
for where to find it in Galileo’s works. Galileo’s alleged rule about measurement can be traced back to
the works of two nineteenth century French scholars. This phrase was subsequently picked up by some
internationally renowned scientists, who were responsible for its dissemination in German and English
books and articles. The two English versions of the measurement quotation published by Hermann Weyl
in the late forties of the last century strongly contributed to its worldwide diffusion. The sentence was
even re-translated into German and French, and in recent scientific textbooks it is frequently used in or-
der to characterize the methods of modern science. Notwithstanding its increasing popularity, referring
to this expression as a quotation from Galileo is a striking example of academic sloppiness.
The translation error concerns the name of the Roman Academy of which Galileo was a member.
Referring to its emblem, a lynx, Accademia dei lincei is often translated as “Academy of (the) Lynxes”.
But the Italian noun for lynx is feminine (la lince), and the Italian translation of “Academy of the Lynx-
es” would be Accademia delle linci. The adjective linceo, however, means “lynx-eyed” in the sense
of “sharp-sighted”, and therefore the correct translation of Accademia dei lincei is “Academy of the
Lynx-Eyed”.","quotes, nice quote, Galileo Galilei, history of science, "

Coblin2019,"Two points are significant here, one major and the other minor. First, Bloomfield
surely knew exactly how the various sets in each of these groups differed semantically
and/or in other respects. And he of course also knew the correspondence patterns and
concomitant reconstructive procedures he had formulated for dealing with such data in
his 1925 paper. When he compiled these sets and posited his reconstructions for them, he
probably drew on this mentally stored information virtually instantaneously as needed
and in no set order, rather than proceeding mechanically, step by step, as a computer
would do. But what is of primary interest to us here is that, had he for some reason been
compelled to move forward in such a stepwise manner, it is likely that he could have first
assembled his sets by gross inspection of the phonological forms and general semantic
meanings of the comparanda. Then he could have posited his reconstructions without
drawing on further information about the data. And, finally, when all this had been done
he could have turned to the questions of exactly how the sets differed, whether
semantically or otherwise, and what there was in the forms themselves, or elsewhere in
the languages, that signaled these differences. In other words, had it been necessary, he
could have performed the task of phonological reconstruction without reference to the
precise semantic or other content of the sets. What was essential was gross semantic
identity and systematic and patterned structural parallelism within each set. Determining
and semantic differences between then, and how and why these existed, could have been
deferred to a later stage of the investigation, had that been necessary or preferable.","Chinese, stratification, correspondence patterns, Chinese dialects, linguistic reconstruction, "

Chandra2019,"In current generative terms, individual features trigger small-scale micro and nano-level differences among
mutually intelligible varieties with shared geography (cf. Barbiers 2009, Kayne 2000, 2013). However, as we
show in this paper, dialects may also exhibit macro-level differences such as in the domain of case alignment.
Specifically, we employ novel data on ergativity from Braj, a Western Indo-Aryan language, to present two
such instances. First, despite a rigid ergative system in the transitive domain, some Braj varieties have
undergone a macro-level change in the unergative domain by opting for phi-triggering, unmarked/nominative
subjects. Another instance of a macro-level difference is provided by the duality of grammars within two
registers of the same Braj variety. The occurrence of such macro-level differences at the dialectal level is
unexplained in the literature, which advocates a complete separation of big, structural differences from
featural variation (Baker 2008). Our submission is that structural differences also define dialects and registers,
though they are mostly restricted to specific domains, unlike those found in typologically distinct languages
with typical cascading effects.","Indo-Aryan languages, dialects, linguistic diversity, "

additional support values for clades and to help to choose between equally parsimonious or

characterization of transitions at the interface between dialectal variants is missing. We conceptualize these transitions
as gradients, aiming to quantitatively account for the transition patterns which are traditionally only implicitly inferred
from visualizations. Fitting of logistic functions in different spatial scopes (profiles as well as surfaces) is proposed as an
approach to model the transition at the interface between the dominant usage areas of dialectal variants. Logistic functions
can accommodate the breadth of boundary concepts, ranging from sharp isoglosses to transitions with different
gradualities. The parameters of the fitted logistic models as well as supplementary measures then allow for the quantitative
characterization and comparison of transitions across variables. To demonstrate the proposed methodology, we use Swiss

Pagel2019,"A puzzle of language is how speakers come to use the same words
for particular meanings, given that there are often many compet-
ing alternatives (e.g., “sofa,” “couch,” “settee”), and there is sel-
dom a necessary connection between a word and its meaning. The
well-known process of random drift—roughly corresponding in
this context to “say what you hear”—can cause the frequencies
of alternative words to fluctuate over time, and it is even possible
for one of the words to replace all others, without any form of selec-
tion being involved. However, is drift alone an adequate explanation
of a shared vocabulary? Darwin thought not. Here, we apply models
of neutral drift, directional selection, and positive frequency-
dependent selection to explain over 417,000 word-use choices for
418 meanings in two natural populations of speakers. We find that
neutral drift does not in general explain word use. Instead, some form
of selection governs word choice in over 91% of the meanings we
studied. In cases where one word dominates all others for a particular
meaning—such as is typical of the words in the core lexicon of a
language—word choice is guided by positive frequency-dependent
selection—a bias that makes speakers disproportionately likely to
use the words that most others use. This bias grants an increasing
advantage to the common form as it becomes more popular and

Cuskley2019,"We report associations between vowel sounds, graphemes, and colors collected online from over 1,000 Dutch speakers. We also
provide open materials, including a Python implementation of the structure measure and code for a single-page web application to run
simple cross-modal tasks. We also provide a full dataset of color–vowel associations from 1,164 participants, including over 200
synesthetes identified using consistency measures. Our analysis reveals salient patterns in the cross-modal associations and introduces
a novel measure of isomorphism in cross-modal mappings. We found that, while the acoustic features of vowels significantly predict
certain mappings (replicating prior work), both vowel phoneme category and grapheme category are even better predictors of color
choice. Phoneme category is the best predictor of color choice overall, pointing to the importance of phonological representations in
addition to acoustic cues. Generally, high/front vowels are lighter, more green, and more yellow than low/back vowels. Synesthetes
respond more strongly on some dimensions, choosing lighter and more yellow colors for high and mid front vowels than do
nonsynesthetes. We also present a novel measure of cross-modal mappings adapted from ecology, which uses a simulated distribution
of mappings to measure the extent to which participants’ actual mappings are structured isomorphically across modalities.
Synesthetes have mappings that tend to be more structured than nonsynesthetes’, and more consistent color choices across trials
correlate with higher structure scores. Nevertheless, the large majority (~ 70%) of participants produce structured mappings, indi-
cating that the capacity to make isomorphically structured mappings across distinct modalities is shared to a large extent, even if the
exact nature of the mappings varies across individuals. Overall, this novel structure measure suggests a distribution of structured
cross-modal association in the population, with synesthetes at one extreme and participants with unstructured associations at the other.","color terms, synaesthesia, empirical study, "

to explain a typological universal. To overcome this empirical bottleneck, one can
simulate the process of language evolution in artificial language learning exper-

that language users have a bias towards the efficient organisation of communica-

by longer forms. This supports the economy-based explanation of the universal

Serzant2019,"Standard typological methods are designed to test hypotheses on strong universals
that broadly override all other competing universal and language-specific forces.
In this paper, I argue that there exist also weak universal forces. Weak universal
forces systematically operate in the course of development but then interact with,
or are even subsequently overridden by, other processes such as analogical exten-
sion, persistence effects from the source function, etc. This, in turn, means that
there can be statistically significant evidence for violations at the synchronic level
and, accordingly, only a weak positive statistical signal. But crucially, the absence
of statistical prima-facie evidence for such forces does not amount to evidence for
their absence. The assumption that there are also weak universal forces that affect
language evolution goes in line with the view that human cognition in general and
language acquisition in particular are constrained by probabilistic biases of differ-
ent range, including weak ones (cf. Thompson et al. 2016). By way of example, the
present paper claims that the discriminatory function of case in differential object
marking (DOM) systems is a weak universal: It keeps appearing in historically, syn-
chronically and typologically very divergent constellations but is often overridden
by other processes in further developments and is, therefore, not significant at the
synchronic level in a large sample.","universals, grammaticalization, linguistic typology"
Winters2019,"Humans commit information to graphic symbols for three basic reasons: as a memory aid,
as a tool for thinking, and as a means of communication. Yet, despite the benefits of transmit-
ting information graphically, we still know very little about the biases and constraints acting
on the emergence of stable, powerful, and accurate graphic codes (such as writing). Using a
reference game, where participants play as Messengers and Recipients, we experimentally
manipulate the function of the task (communicative or non-communicative) and investigate
whether this shapes the emergence of stable, powerful, and accurate codes for both syn-
chronous and asynchronous modes of information transfer. Only in the Dialogue condition,
where Messenger and Recipient are two different persons communicating within the same time
frame (i.e., synchronously), do we consistently observe the emergence of stable, powerful, and
accurate graphic codes. Such codes are unnecessary for participants in Recall, where Messenger
and Recipient are the same person transferring information within the same time frame, and
they fail to emerge in Correspondence, where Messenger and Recipient are two different per-
sons communicating across time frames (i.e., asynchronously). Lastly, in the Mnemonic condi-
tion, where Messenger and Recipient are the same person at different points in time,
participants achieve high accuracy but with codes that are suboptimal in terms of power and
stability. Our results suggest that the rarity and late arrival of stable, powerful, and accurate
graphic codes in human history largely stems from strong constraints on information transfer.
In particular, we suggest that these constraints limit a code’s ability to reach an adequate trade-
off between information that needs to be explicitly encoded and information that needs to be
inferred from context.","graphic code, writing systems, artificial language learning, "
Suchard2019,"For nearly a thousand years, the texts of the Hebrew Bible were transmitted both in writing, as
consonantal texts lacking much of the information about their pronunciation, and orally, as an
accompanying reading tradition which supplied this information. During this period of oral trans-
mission, sound changes affected the reading tradition. This paper identifies a number of sound
changes that took place in the reading tradition by comparing their effects on Biblical Hebrew to
those on Biblical Aramaic, the related but distinct language of a small part of the biblical corpus.
Sound changes that affect both languages equally probably took place in the reading tradition,
while those that are limited to one language probably preceded this shared oral transmission.
Drawing this distinction allows us to reconstruct the pronunciation of Biblical Aramaic as it was
fixed in the reading tradition, highlighting several morphological discrepancies between the dialect
underlying it and that of the consonantal texts.","Biblical Hebrew, Aramaic, sound change, linguistic reconstruction"

evolutionary puzzles 1–8 . The ‘moralizing gods’ hypothesis offers
a solution to both puzzles by proposing that belief in morally
concerned supernatural agents culturally evolved to facilitate
cooperation among strangers in large-scale societies 9–13 . Although
previous research has suggested an association between the presence
of moralizing gods and social complexity 3,6,7,9–18 , the relationship

causality have been hampered by limitations in the availability of
detailed global longitudinal data. To overcome these limitations,
here we systematically coded records from 414 societies that span
the past 10,000 years from 30 regions around the world, using
51 measures of social complexity and 4 measures of supernatural
enforcement of morality. Our analyses not only confirm the
association between moralizing gods and social complexity, but
also reveal that moralizing gods follow—rather than precede—
large increases in social complexity. Contrary to previous
predictions 9,12,16,18 , powerful moralizing ‘big gods’ and prosocial
supernatural punishment tend to appear only after the emergence
of ‘megasocieties’ with populations of more than around one million
people. Moralizing gods are not a prerequisite for the evolution
of social complexity, but they may help to sustain and expand
complex multi-ethnic empires after they have become established.
By contrast, rituals that facilitate the standardization of religious
traditions across large populations 25,26 generally precede the

Gibson2019,"A potential solution to this problem lies in the classic learning problem for language: how
learners can acquire facility with an infinitely expressive system mapping forms to meanings
from limited exposure? For the most frequently intended meanings, learners encounter suffi-
cient learning instances to support a holistic, memorized relationship between utterance form
and meaning, such as the English greeting ‘Hello’. But in light of the complete repertoire of
utterance meanings that a speaker may need to convey or understand, the totality of any native
speaker's linguistic experience is extraordinarily sparse. For our species, the solution to this
problem is that language is compositional: smaller meaningful forms can be put together into a
novel, larger form whose meaning is a predictable function of its parts [5].  By mastering the
basic units and composition functions of a compositional system through simplicity principles
[128,133, @Smith2017a ] a learner can acquire an infinitely expressive set of form–meaning mappings.
Humans might have a strong inductive bias constraining language learning to some set of
compositional systems, which may have emerged as a side effect of multiple evolutionary
events in our lineage [134] or which may have been selected for directly [135]. An alternative,
usage-based possibility is that languages might have become compositional through diahronic selection from the transmission bottleneck in their cultural evolution [136–138]. Even if a
noncompositional system were perfectly human-learnable from sufficient evidence, it could not
survive over generations, due to input sparsity for any individual learner.","compositionality, language learning,language acquisition, "

Smith2017a,"Linguistic universals arise from the interaction between the processes of language learning and language use. A test case for the relationship between these factors is linguistic variation, which tends to be conditioned on linguistic or sociolinguistic criteria. How can we explain the scarcity of unpredictable variation in natural language, and to what extent is this property of language a straightforward reflection of biases in statistical learning? We review three strands of experimental work exploring these questions, and introduce a Bayesian model of the learning and transmission of linguistic variation along with a closely matched artificial language learning experiment with adult participants. Our results show that while the biases of language learners can potentially play a role in shaping linguistic systems, the relationship between biases of learners and the structure of languages is not straightforward. Weak biases can have strong effects on language structure as they accumulate over repeated transmission. But the opposite can also be true: strong biases can have weak or no effects. Furthermore, the use of language during interaction can reshape linguistic systems. Combining data and insights from studies of learning, transmission and use is therefore essential if we are to understand how biases in statistical learning interact with language transmission and language use to shape the structural properties of language.","linguistic variation, language learning, artificial language learning"

Durand1990,"In positing phonemes, we operate at a fair degree of abstraction
from real sounds by thinking of contrasting units at a given
position within words. Observation of speech-events reveals,
however, that sounds which we consider as tokens of identical
phonemes can in fact be noticeably different according to their
position within words or sentences. Let us take a familiar
example from English. If we consider two words such as train [pb]

and rain, transcribed in this book as /trejn/ and /rejn/, we find
that the /r/ in train is auditorily different from the /r/ in rain.
Under the influence of /t/ which is voiceless and aspirated in this
position, the /r/ is partially devoiced and some friction is audible.
We can indicate the distinction between these two r's by phonetic
transcriptions (within square brackets) such as [rejn] vs. [trejn].
The reason why speakers of English do not normally attend to
this phonetic distinction, and cope well with a writing system
which uses only one r symbol, is that no two words of English
are differentiated by [r] vs. [r]. These two r's are contextual
realizations, technically called allophones, of the phoneme /r/.
Following classical assumptions, we can say that there are two
fundamental levels of representation of sounds: the level of
phonemes (phonemic level) and the level of allophones (phonetic
level). ","phonology, abstraction, phonological rules, allophone, "

two levels of representation was not usually considered a burning

committed to a programme where the primitive terms and the
rules for their combination and transformation must be couched
in symbolic notation and formally defined. Thereby, an important
step is taken towards making the system easier to fault, or to [pb]
refute, and our descriptions should be highly valued according
to a common view of what defines a scientific enterprise.","phonological rules, introduction, description, "

nasal glottal fricative [h ̃ ]. We provide a synchronic description of these two types of

role of language in accessing and communicating about feelings. The second is the
demonstrated existence of substantial, culture-related differences between the meanings of
emotional expressions in the languages of the world. We contend that the NSM approach to

Gao2019,"Peer review is a core element of the scientific
process, particularly in conference-centered
fields such as ML and NLP. However, only
few studies have evaluated its properties em-
pirically. Aiming to fill this gap, we present
a corpus that contains over 4k reviews and
1.2k author responses from ACL-2018. We
quantitatively and qualitatively assess the cor-
pus. This includes a pilot study on paper
weaknesses given by reviewers and on qual-
ity of author responses. We then focus on
the role of the rebuttal phase, and propose
a novel task to predict after-rebuttal (i.e., fi-
nal) scores from initial reviews and author re-
sponses. Although author responses do have
a marginal (and statistically significant) influ-
ence on the final scores, especially for bor-

her initial score and the distance to the other
reviewers’ initial scores. In this context, we
discuss the conformity bias inherent to peer
reviewing, a bias that has largely been over-

analyses will help better assess the usefulness
of the rebuttal phase in NLP conferences.","review practice, NLP, discussion, analysis"

Li2019,"Tianjin Mandarin is a member of the northern Mandarin Chinese family (ISO 693-3: [cmn]).
It is spoken in the urban areas of the Tianjin Municipality (CN-12) in the People’s Republic of
China, which is about 120 kilometers to the southeast of Beijing. Existing studies on Tianjin
Mandarin have focused mainly on its tonal aspects, especially its intriguing tone sandhi
system, with few studies examining the segmental aspects (on tone, see e.g. Li & Liu 1985,
Shi 1986, Liu 1993, Lu 1997, Wang & Jiang 1997, Chen 2000, Liu & Gao 2003, Ma 2005, Ma

b; Wee, Yan & Chen 2005). As also noted in Wee et al. (2005), this is probably due to the
similarity in segmental structures between Tianjin Mandarin and Standard Chinese, especially
among speakers of the younger generation, and what differentiates the two Mandarin varieties
is most notably their tonal systems. The aim of the present description is therefore to provide
a systematic phonetic description of both segmental and tonal aspects of Tianjin Mandarin,

Wen2004b,"Hmong-Mien (H-M) is a major language family in East Asia, and its speakers distribute primarily in southern China and
Southeast Asia. To date, genetic studies on H-M speaking populations are virtually absent in the literature. In this report, we
present the results of an analysis of genetic variations in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) hypervariable segment 1 (HVS1)
region and diagnostic variants in the coding regions in 537 individuals sampled from 17 H-M populations across East Asia.
The analysis showed that the haplogroups that are predominant in southern East Asia, including B, R9, N9a, and M7,
account for 63% (ranging from 45% to 90%) of mtDNAs in H-M populations. Furthermore, analysis of molecular variance
(AMOVA), phylogenetic tree analysis, and principal component (PC) analysis demonstrate closer relatedness between H-M
and other southern East Asians, suggesting a general southern origin of maternal lineages in the H-M populations. The
estimated ages of the mtDNA lineages that are specific to H-M coincide with those based on archeological cultures that have
been associated with H-M. Analysis of genetic distance and phylogenetic tree indicated some extent of difference between
the Hmong and the Mien populations. Together with the higher frequency of north-dominating lineages observed in the
Hmong people, our results indicate that the Hmong populations had experienced more contact with the northern East
Asians, a finding consistent with historical evidence. Moreover, our data defined some new (sub-)haplogroups (A6, B4e,

Pereira2018,"Prior work decoding linguistic meaning from imaging data has been largely limited to con-

semantic categories. Here we present a new approach for building a brain decoding system in
which words and sentences are represented as vectors in a semantic space constructed from
massive text corpora. By efficiently sampling this space to select training stimuli shown to
subjects, we maximize the ability to generalize to new meanings from limited imaging data.
To validate this approach, we train the system on imaging data of individual concepts, and
show it can decode semantic vector representations from imaging data of sentences about a
wide variety of both concrete and abstract topics from two separate datasets. These decoded
representations are sufficiently detailed to distinguish even semantically similar sentences,
and to capture the similarity structure of meaning relationships between sentences.","linguistic meaning, imaging data, neurolinguistics, neuroscience"
Seifart2018b,"By force of nature, every bit of spoken language is produced at a
particular speed. However, this speed is not constant—speakers
regularly speed up and slow down. Variation in speech rate is influ-
enced by a complex combination of factors, including the frequency
and predictability of words, their information status, and their po-
sition within an utterance. Here, we use speech rate as an index of
word-planning effort and focus on the time window during which
speakers prepare the production of words from the two major lex-
ical classes, nouns and verbs. We show that, when naturalistic
speech is sampled from languages all over the world, there is a
robust cross-linguistic tendency for slower speech before nouns
compared with verbs, both in terms of slower articulation and more
pauses. We attribute this slowdown effect to the increased amount
of planning that nouns require compared with verbs. Unlike verbs,
nouns can typically only be used when they represent new or un-
expected information; otherwise, they have to be replaced by pro-
nouns or be omitted. These conditions on noun use appear to
outweigh potential advantages stemming from differences in in-
ternal complexity between nouns and verbs. Our findings suggest
that, beneath the staggering diversity of grammatical structures
and cultural settings, there are robust universals of language pro-
cessing that are intimately tied to how speakers manage referential
information when they communicate with one another.","speed, communication speed, communication, word-planning effort, language universals, language processing"

however, have mainly focussed on populations residing far to the north and/or south of this mountain range, and have not

Goddard2019,"We commend the target paper (henceforth S&N) for bringing reported speech to
attention in the typological space, and for making a number of highly pertinent
observations. We agree that reported speech deserves to be seen as a sui generis

intersection of other phenomena. We would prefer to characterise it as a seman-
tic or functional domain, rather than as a “syntactic” domain, given that key
aspects of S&N’s definition hinge on semantic notions, but this is not our main
concern in this commentary. Instead, we would like to take issue with the target
paper on more important theoretical and methodological matters. The most
significant concerns S&N’s reliance on complex, poorly-defined, English-bound
terms, including both technical terms such as semiotic, ‘demonstratedness’,
epistemic, modality, and representation, and ordinary, but equally English-
bound, words such as report(ed), message, discourse, and utterance. In this

that the use of such opaque and/or English-bound terminology is unnecessary

GellMann2011,"Recent work in comparative linguistics suggests that all, or almost
all, attested human languages may derive from a single earlier
language. If that is so, then this language—like nearly all extant
languages—most likely had a basic ordering of the subject (S),
verb (V), and object (O) in a declarative sentence of the type
“the man (S) killed (V) the bear (O).” When one compares the
distribution of the existing structural types with the putative phy-
logenetic tree of human languages, four conclusions may be
drawn. (i) The word order in the ancestral language was SOV.
(ii) Except for cases of diffusion, the direction of syntactic change,
when it occurs, has been for the most part SOV > SVO and, beyond
that, SVO > VSO/VOS with a subsequent reversion to SVO occur-
ring occasionally. Reversion to SOV occurs only through diffusion.
(iii) Diffusion, although important, is not the dominant process in
the evolution of word order. (iv) The two extremely rare word
orders (OVS and OSV) derive directly from SOV.","word order, universals, proto-world, "
Round2011,"The notion of ‘erosion’, a universal diachronic process affecting the phonetic content of
certain language forms, has held a place in historical linguistics for almost two centuries
now. Recently it has been argued that the erosion of high frequency words can be derived
as a consequence of normal language use within a theory of phonology based on
exemplars. Focusing on discrete changes to function words, this paper argues that types of
erosion exist which cannot be derived in this manner. Instead, erosion as well as other less
celebrated, but well attested, irregular changes to function words can be accounted for by a
species of paradigm levelling. Prosodic paradigm levelling (PPL) is much like its familiar
morphological cousin only it plays out over paradigms whose cells contain word forms
selected for by prosodic, not morphological, features. While PPL can account for data
which exemplar models cannot, it is maintained nevertheless that exemplar models can
offer a reasonable account of much of the data, provided that the model incorporates a
discrete level of phonological representation, in addition to exemplars. Arguments
presented have implications for phonological representation in general, as well as for the
explanation of discrete, irregular change to function words.","incomplete lineage sorting, erosion, sound change"

underlie both linguistic and biological diversification. Here we present the first global analysis
of language diversity that compares the relative importance of two key ecological mechan-

genetic non-independence. We find significant effects of climate on language diversity,
consistent with the ecological risk hypothesis that areas of high year-round productivity lead
to more languages by supporting human cultural groups with smaller distributions. Climate
has a much stronger effect on language diversity than landscape features, such as altitudinal
range and river density, which might contribute to isolation of cultural groups. The asso-

covariation with climate, rather than a causal link between the two.","linguistic diversity, computational approaches, climate, correlational studies, "

Baayen2019,"This methodological study provides a step-by-step introduction to a compu-
tational implementation of word and paradigm morphology using linear
mappings between vector spaces for form and meaning. Taking as starting
point the linear regression model, the main concepts underlying linear
mappings are introduced and illustrated with R code. It is then shown how
vector spaces can be set up for Latin verb conjugations, using 672 inflected
variants of two verbs each from the four main conjugation classes. It turns
out that mappings from form to meaning (comprehension), and from
meaning to form (production) can be carried out loss-free. This study
concludes with a demonstration that when the graph of triphones, the units
that underlie the form space, is mapped onto a 2-dimensional space with a
self-organising algorithm from physics (graphopt), morphological functions
show topological clustering, even though morphemic units do not play any
role whatsoever in the model. It follows, first, that evidence for morphemes
emerging from experimental studies using, for instance, fMRI, to localize
morphemes in the brain, does not guarantee the existence of morphemes in
the brain, and second, that potential topological organization of morpholog-
ical form in the cortex may depend to a high degree on the morphological

first result is that these three classes of human visual sign possess a
similar signature in their configuration distribution, suggesting that
there are underlying principles governing the shapes of human visual

Finally, we provide evidence to support an ecological hypothesis that

a phenomenon not previously discussed with reference to these problems. In the
cases discussed in this article it is the avoidance of forms that are semantically
or pragmatically inappropriate within the context of the paradigm in which they
occur which renders the forms morphologically variable and the paradigms in
which they occur unstable. In Malayo-Polynesian languages, it is the avoidance
of a form that is reconstructed as a plural pronoun in Proto-Austronesian but
which in all Malayo-Polynesian daughter languages is found as a singular pro-
noun. Where this form is retained as part of some other plural forms, it has been

Thornton2012,"Overabundance occurs when two or more forms are available to realize the same cell in

tends to be better preserved in low-frequency items and in forms learned relatively
late appear confirmed by the Italian data; in addition, conscious normative

conclusion, this study shows that overabundance is a genuine type of non-canonical

Kentner2019,"Does linguistic rhythm matter to syntax, and if so, what kinds of syntactic decisions are susceptible to rhythm? By means of two recall-based sentence production experiments and two corpus studies – one on spoken and one on written language – we investigated whether linguistic rhythm affects the choice between introduced and un-introduced complement clauses in German. Apart from the presence or absence of the complementiser dass (‘that’), these two sentence types differ with respect to the position of the tensed verb (verb-final/verb-second). Against our predictions, that were based on previously reported rhythmic effects on the use of the optional complementiser that in English, the experiments fail to obtain compelling evidence for rhythmic/prosodic influences on the structure of complement clauses in German. An overview of pertinent studies showing rhythmic influences on syntactic encoding suggests these effects to be generally restricted to syntactic domains smaller than a clause. We assume that, in the course of language production, initially, clause level syntactic projections are specified; their specification is in fact the prerequisite for phonological encoding to start. Consequently, prosodic effects may only touch upon the lower level categories that are to be integrated into the clausal projection, but not upon the syntactic makeup of the higher order projection itself.","prosody, linguistic change, syntax, rhythm, pragmatic evolution, poetic function, "
Eckert2019,"I present the extreme proposal that change spreads by virtue of its role in a system of social meaning. And since individuals cannot construct meaning on their own, they can play no elemental role in sound change. Based on ethnographic-variationist studies of sound change among preadolescents and adolescents, I challenge two common assumptions in the study of variation and change: (1) that sound change is autonomous, and (2) that change spreads from individual to individual, by imitation and in isolation. Whatever its origins, whether from linguistic pressures (“change from below”) or social pressures (“change from above”), sound change spreads by virtue of its incorporation into a semiotic landscape, as non-referential material is recruited into signs articulating social distinctions. Participation in this landscape connects the individual to the immediate community and to the larger social order and it is through participation in this landscape that speakers produce and perceive – and accelerate – changes in progress.","sound change, actuation problem, semiotics, social class, pragmatic evolution"
Dediu2019,"This paper argues that inter-individual and inter-group variation in language acquisition, perception, processing and production, rooted in our biology, may play a largely neglected role in sound change. We begin by discussing the patterning of these differences, highlighting those related to vocal tract anatomy with a foundation in genetics and development. We use our ArtiVarK database, a large multi-ethnic sample comprising 3D intraoral optical scans, as well as structural, static and real-time MRI scans of vocal tract anatomy and speech articulation, to quantify the articulatory strategies used to produce the North American English /r/ and to statistically show that anatomical factors seem to influence these articulatory strategies. Building on work showing that these alternative articulatory strategies may have indirect coarticulatory effects, we propose two models for how biases due to variation in vocal tract anatomy may affect sound change. The first involves direct overt acoustic effects of such biases that are then reinterpreted by the hearers, while the second is based on indirect coarticulatory phenomena generated by acoustically covert biases that produce overt “at-a-distance” acoustic effects. This view implies that speaker communities might be “poised” for change because they always contain pools of “standing variation” of such biased speakers, and when factors such as the frequency of the biased speakers in the community, their positions in the communicative network or the topology of the network itself change, sound change may rapidly follow as a self-reinforcing network-level phenomenon, akin to a phase transition. Thus, inter-speaker variation in structured and dynamic communicative networks may couple the initiation and actuation of sound change.","pragmatic evolution, actuation problem, sound change, experimental phonetics, "
Stevens2019,"The study explored whether an asymmetric phonetic overlap between speech sounds could be turned into sound change through propagation around a community of speakers. The focus was on the change of /s/ to /ʃ/ which is known to be more likely than a change in the other direction both synchronically and diachronically. An agent-based model was used to test the prediction that communication between agents would advance /s/-retraction in /str/ clusters (e.g. string). There was one agent per speaker and the probabilistic mapping between words, phonological classes, and speech signals could be updated during communication depending on whether an agent listener absorbed an incoming speech signal from an agent talker into memory. Following
interaction, sibilants in /str/ clusters were less likely to share a phonological class with prevocalic /s/ and were acoustically closer to /ʃ/. The findings lend support to the idea that sound change is the outcome of a fortuitous combination of the relative size and orientation of phonetic distributions, their association to phonological classes, and how these types of information vary between speakers that happen to interact with each other.","sound change, artificial agents, pragmatic evolution"
Linzen2018,"The reliability of acceptability judgments made by individual linguists has often been called into question. Recent large-scale replication studies conducted in response to this criticism have shown that the majority of published English acceptability judgments are robust. We make two observations about these replication studies. First, we raise the concern that English acceptability judgments may be more reliable than judgments in other languages. Second, we argue that it is unnecessary to replicate judgments that illustrate uncontroversial descriptive facts; rather, candidates for replication can emerge during formal or informal peer review. We present two experiments motivated by these arguments. Published Hebrew and Japanese acceptability contrasts considered questionable by the authors of the present paper were rated for acceptability by a large sample of naive participants. Approximately half of the contrasts did not replicate.

Langsford2018,"Understanding and measuring sentence acceptability is of fundamental importance for linguists, but although many measures for doing so have been developed, relatively little is known about some of their psychometric properties. In this paper we evaluate within- and between-participant test-retest reliability on a wide range of measures of sentence acceptability. Doing so allows us to estimate how much of the variability within each measure is due to factors including participant-level individual differences, sample size, response styles, and item effects. The measures examined include Likert scales, two versions of forced-choice judgments, magnitude estimation, and a novel measure based on Thurstonian approaches in psychophysics. We reproduce previous findings of high between-participant reliability within and across measures, and extend these results to a generally high reliability within individual items and individual people. Our results indicate that Likert scales and the Thurstonian approach produce the most stable and reliable acceptability measures and do so with smaller sample sizes than the other measures. Moreover, their agreement with each other suggests that the limitation of a discrete Likert scale does not impose a significant degree of structure on the resulting acceptability judgments.","acceptability judgments, sentence acceptability, empirical study"
Katz2018,"This paper presents evidence that spirantization, a cross-linguistically common lenition process, affects English listeners’ ease of segmenting novel “words” in an artificial language. The cross-linguistically common spirantization pattern of initial stops and medial continuants (e.g. [ɡuβa]) results in improved word segmentation compared to the inverse “anti-lenition” pattern of initial continuants and medial stops (e.g. [ɣuba]). The study also tests the effect of obstruent voicing, another common lenition pattern, but finds no significant differences in segmentation performance. There are several points of broader interest in these studies. Most of the phonetic factors influencing word segmentation in past studies have been language-specific and/or prosodic in nature: stress, intonation, final lengthening, etc. Spirantization, while often prosodically conditioned, is different from all of these patterns in that it concerns a segmental alternation. Moreover, the effects reported here are for speakers of a language, American English, that only sporadically displays spirantization, and not in the phonological contexts used in the experiment. This suggests that the results may reflect more general properties of speech perception and word boundary detection, rather than a perceptual processing strategy transferred directly from English. As such, the studies offer partial support for theories of lenition rooted in notions of perceptual-acoustic continuity and disruption.","spirantization, fricativization, sound change, artificial language learning, word boundary detection, morpheme segmentation, "

Employing a Quantity Judgment Task (Barner & Snedeker 2005), we examined the interpretation of unclassified nouns of different ontological types (count, mass, flexible, object-mass) in both adult and child Mandarin. In order to explain possible interpretational preferences, we also analysed the distributions of the tested nouns in the Chinese Internet Corpus (Sharoff 2006). The results of 27 adults and 55 children (2;11–5;09), together with the corpus data provide strong support for Pelletier. We therefore conclude that Mandarin nouns are semantically both count and mass, and receive a number-based or a volume-based interpretation according to the type of classifier they appear with. However, we argue for one exception in this respect: following Bale & Barner (2009) we assume that nouns of the object-mass type (e.g., furniture) are marked for individualization in the lexicon. Finally, the emergence of adultlike preferences for number-based or volume-based interpretations in child Mandarin is argued to be linked to the acquisition of the classifier system.

This paper provides a computational analysis of long-distance consonant agreement and shows that it belongs to a more restricted computational class called subsequential. This paper further argues that subsequentiality is a desirable computational characterization of long-distance consonant agreement for the following reasons. First, it is sufficiently expressive. Second, it is restrictive as it accounts for the absence of pathological patterns like Majority Rules and Sour Grapes from the typology (Heinz & Lai 2013), standing in contrast to Agreement by Correspondence analysis in Optimality Theory (Rose & Walker 2004; Hansson 2007).","phonological rules, phonotactics, regular grammar, long-distance consonant agreement, complexity, "

Horn1997,"In everyday speech, we often use words more to do things (e.g., greet, make bets, accuse, ask, marry, etc.) than to make statements of fact. In the philosophy of language, viewing utterances as these sorts of speech acts (Austin 1962), or as moves in a language game (Wittgenstein 1958), challenged the view of communication as an exchange of true or false propositions. For ethologists, applying similar concepts to animal signals may help keep concepts like information, manipulation, and honesty in their proper perspective. This essay shows the many parallels between speech acts and animal signals, and touches on their implications. According to this perspective, the main function of signals is not to state facts, although facts (e.g., about honesty, intentions, and external referents) are crucial for the evolutionary stability of signals. Just as the speech acts in a marriage ceremony resist translation into facts outside of the social system of which they are a part, most animal signals will likely resist translation into general classes of messages or functions. Nonetheless, if the rules that govern the use of signals are sufficiently understood, the parts played by manipulation and information in the evolution of those rules can also be understood.","pragmatic evolution, speech act, animal signals"

But despite that long relationship with alcohol, we still don’t know what exactly the molecule does to our brains to create a feeling of intoxication. Likewise, though the health harms of heavy drinking are fairly obvious, scientists have struggled to identify what negative impacts lesser volumes may lead to. Last September, the prestigious peer-reviewed British medical journal The Lancet published a study [@GBGAlcohol2018] that is thought to be the most comprehensive global analysis of the risks of alcohol consumption. Its conclusion, which the media widely reported, sounded unequivocal: “The safest level of drinking is none.”

GBGAlcohol2018,"Background

Alcohol use is a leading risk factor for death and disability, but its overall association with health remains complex given the possible protective effects of moderate alcohol consumption on some conditions. With our comprehensive approach to health accounting within the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016, we generated improved estimates of alcohol use and alcohol-attributable deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 195 locations from 1990 to 2016, for both sexes and for 5-year age groups between the ages of 15 years and 95 years and older.

Methods

Using 694 data sources of individual and population-level alcohol consumption, along with 592 prospective and retrospective studies on the risk of alcohol use, we produced estimates of the prevalence of current drinking, abstention, the distribution of alcohol consumption among current drinkers in standard drinks daily (defined as 10 g of pure ethyl alcohol), and alcohol-attributable deaths and DALYs. We made several methodological improvements compared with previous estimates: first, we adjusted alcohol sales estimates to take into account tourist and unrecorded consumption; second, we did a new meta-analysis of relative risks for 23 health outcomes associated with alcohol use; and third, we developed a new method to quantify the level of alcohol consumption that minimises the overall risk to individual health.

Findings

Globally, alcohol use was the seventh leading risk factor for both deaths and DALYs in 2016, accounting for 2·2% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 1·5–3·0) of age-standardised female deaths and 6·8% (5·8–8·0) of age-standardised male deaths. Among the population aged 15–49 years, alcohol use was the leading risk factor globally in 2016, with 3·8% (95% UI 3·2–4·3) of female deaths and 12·2% (10·8–13·6) of male deaths attributable to alcohol use. For the population aged 15–49 years, female attributable DALYs were 2·3% (95% UI 2·0–2·6) and male attributable DALYs were 8·9% (7·8–9·9). The three leading causes of attributable deaths in this age group were tuberculosis (1·4% [95% UI 1·0–1·7] of total deaths), road injuries (1·2% [0·7–1·9]), and self-harm (1·1% [0·6–1·5]). For populations aged 50 years and older, cancers accounted for a large proportion of total alcohol-attributable deaths in 2016, constituting 27·1% (95% UI 21·2–33·3) of total alcohol-attributable female deaths and 18·9% (15·3–22·6) of male deaths. The level of alcohol consumption that minimised harm across health outcomes was zero (95% UI 0·0–0·8) standard drinks per week.

Interpretation

Alcohol use is a leading risk factor for global disease burden and causes substantial health loss. We found that the risk of all-cause mortality, and of cancers specifically, rises with increasing levels of consumption, and the level of consumption that minimises health loss is zero. These results suggest that alcohol control policies might need to be revised worldwide, refocusing on efforts to lower overall population-level consumption.","alcohol, bias, medical study, causation, causal inference, "

Bjorgvinsson2011,"This essay examines J.L. Austin's theory regarding speech acts, or how we do
things with words. It starts by reviewing the birth and foundation of speech act theory
as it appeared in the 1955 William James Lectures at Harvard before going into what
Austin's theory is and how it can be applied to the real world.
The theory is explained and analysed both in regards to its faults and
advantages. Proposals for the improvement of the theory are then developed, using the
ideas of other scholars and theorists along with the ideas of the author.
The taxonomy in this essay is vast and various concepts and conditions are
introduced and applied to the theory in order for it to work. Those conditions range
from being conditions of appropriateness through to general principles of
communication.
In this essay utterances are examined by their propositional content, the
intention of the utterance, and its outcome. By studying how utterances are formed and
issued, along with looking into utterance circumstances and sincerity, one can garner a
clear glimpse into what constitutes a performative speech act and what does not.
By applying the ideas of multiple thinkers in unison it becomes clear that a) any
one single theory does not satisfyingly explain all the intricacies of the theory and b)
most utterances which are not in the past tense can be considered to be either
performative or as having some performative force.","speech act, history of science, overview, introduction, "
Butcher2018,"The phonological systems of human languages are constrained by what are often assumed to be universal
properties of human auditory perception. However, the atypical phonologies found in many hearing-
impaired speakers (lack of voicing contrast, lack of fricatives) indicate that such constraints also operate at
an individual level. Thus, if a large group of speakers in a speech community operates with an atypical
auditory system over a number of generations, then it seems logical that the phonology of the language(s)
spoken by such a community would also over time be influenced by the particular properties of that
common auditory system. Over half of the Australian Aboriginal population develop chronic otitis media
with effusion in infancy and 50-70% of Aboriginal children have a significant hearing loss at both the low
and high ends of the frequency range. The majority of Australian languages have phonologies which are
atypical in world terms, having no voicing distinction and no fricatives or affricates, but an unusually large
number of places of articulation. Whilst there would seem to be no way of conclusively demonstrating a
historical causal connection between atypical hearing profiles and atypical phonologies, this paper explores
some of the minimal prerequisites for such a theory.","Australian languages, correlational studies, environmental factors, language change, phonology, phoneme inventory, "

TorresCacoullos2019,"A key parameter in received classifications of language types is the
expression of pronominal subjects. Here we compare variation patterns in conversational data of English – considered a non-null-subject language – and
Spanish – a well-studied null-subject language. English has a patently lower
rate of expression (approximately 3% unexpressed 1sg and 3sg human subjects
vs. 60% in Spanish). Despite the stark difference in rate of expression, the same
probabilistic constraints are at work in the two languages. Contrary to popular
belief, VP coordination is neither a discrete nor a distinguishing category of
English. Instead, a shared constraint is linking with the preceding subject, a
refinement of accessibility to include, alongside coreferentiality, measures of
structural connectedness – both prosodic and syntactic. Other shared con-
straints on unexpressed subjects are coreferential subject priming (a tendency
to repeat the form of the previous mention) and lexical aspect (reflecting the
contribution of a temporal relationship to subject expression). Where the lan-
guages most differ is in the envelope of variation. In English, besides corefer-
ential-subject verbs conjoined with a coordinating conjunction, unexpressed
subjects are limited to prosodic initial-position in declarative main clauses, a
restriction that is absent in Spanish. We propose that the locus of cross-language
comparisons is the variable structure of each language, defined by the set of
probabilistic constraints but also the delimitation of the variable context within
which these are operative.","null subject, pro-drop, language universals, English, Spanish"

processes by a) measuring the change in linguistic similarity given a geographical space, a
socio-cultural setting, a time span, a language sample, and a set of linguistic data, and b)
testing the tendency and magnitude of the process using Bayesian inference. Applying this
approach to the expression of reflexivity in a dense sample of languages in north-western

DeSousa2012,"Within the Mainland Southeast Asian (MSEA) linguistic area (e.g. Matisoff 2003; Bisang

while others are said to be periphery. In the core are Mon-Khmer languages like Vietnamese
and Khmer, and Kra-Dai languages like Lao and Thai. The core languages generally have:

– Lexical tonal and/or phonational contrasts (except that most Khmer dialects lost their
phonational contrasts; languages which are primarily tonal often have five or more
tonemes);

– Analytic morphological profile with many sesquisyllabic or monosyllabic words;

– Strong left-headedness, including prepositions and SVO word order.

The Sino-Tibetan languages, like Burmese and Mandarin, are said to be periphery to the
MSEA linguistic area. The periphery languages have fewer traits that are typical to MSEA.
For instance, Burmese is SOV and right-headed in general, but it has some left-headed traits
like post-nominal adjectives (‘stative verbs’) and numerals. Mandarin is SVO and has
prepositions, but it is otherwise strongly right-headed. These two languages also have fewer

are almost as many interpretations of uniformitarianism as there are historical linguists who

confusion results from the fact that uniformitarianism as originally proposed in geology is not
itself a uniform notion, and permits at least four readings. Only some of these readings involve
substantive claims rather than methodological imperatives, and only some of these readings
are useful for the study of language change. The weakest conclusion to be drawn is that these
distinct notions need to be kept apart when invoked by historical linguists.","uniformitarianism, linguistics, historical linguistics, history of science, overview,"

Portuguese carried it to India, Indonesia, and Africa. The plant has a pre-Magellan

from there to the rest of the Pacific. The plant was transferred either by birds
carrying the seed or, more likely, through an accidental casting of a vessel carrying
it upon an island of the Samoa region. The word kumara, alleged by many to show

Moret2019,"Alexander von Humboldt’s Tableau Physique (1807) has been one
of the most influential diagrams in the history of environmental
sciences. In particular, detailed observations of the altitudinal dis-
tribution of plant species in the equatorial Andes, depicted on a
cross-section of Mt. Chimborazo, allowed Humboldt to establish
the concept of vegetation belt, thereby laying the foundations of
biogeography. Surprisingly, Humboldt’s original data have never
been critically revisited, probably due to the difficulty of gathering
and interpreting dispersed archives. By unearthing and analyzing
overlooked historical documents, we show that the top section of
the Tableau Physique, above the tree line, is an intuitive construct
based on unverified and therefore partly false field data that Hum-
boldt constantly tried to revise in subsequent publications. This
finding has implications for the documentation of climate change
effects in the tropical Andes. We found that Humboldt’s primary
plant data above tree line were mostly collected on Mt. Antisana,
not Chimborazo, which allows a comparison with current records.

Spengler2019,"The apple (Malus domestica [Suckow] Borkh.) is one of the most economically and
culturally significant fruits in the world today, and it is grown in all temperate zones.
With over a thousand landraces recognized, the modern apple provides a unique case
study for understanding plant evolution under human cultivation. Recent genomic and
archaeobotanical studies have illuminated parts of the process of domestication in the
Rosaceae family. Interestingly, these data seem to suggest that rosaceous arboreal
crops did not follow the same pathway toward domestication as other domesticated,
especially annual, plants. Unlike in cereal crops, tree domestication appears to have
been rapid and driven by hybridization. Apple domestication also calls into question
the concept of centers of domestication and human intentionality. Studies of arboreal
domestication also illustrate the importance of fully understanding the seed dispersal
processes in the wild progenitors when studying crop origins. Large fruits in Rosaceae
evolved as a seed-dispersal adaptation recruiting megafaunal mammals of the late
Miocene. Genetic studies illustrate that the increase in fruit size and changes in
morphology during evolution in the wild resulted from hybridization events and were
selected for by large seed dispersers. Humans over the past three millennia have fixed
larger-fruiting hybrids through grafting and cloning. Ultimately, the process of evolution
under human cultivation parallels the natural evolution of larger fruits in the clade as an
adaptive strategy, which resulted in mutualism with large mammalian seed dispersers
(disperser recruitment).","apple, domestication, plants, plant genetics, review,"

has been realized in the case of language evolution, where many of the terms of social
evolution theory (reciprocal altruism, honest signaling, etc.) are incorrectly used in a way
that suggests that certain key fundamentals have been misunderstood. In particular the
distinction between proximate and ultimate explanations is often lost, with the result that
several claims made by those interested in language evolution are epistemically incoherent.

effective sparse sensing approach to general face recognition is not working any-
more for ethnical group facial recognition if the features based on whole face image
are used. This is partially due to a fact that each ethnical group may have its own
characteristics manifesting only in specified face regions. Therefore, we will ana-
lyze the particularity of three ethnical groups and aim to find the common charac-

first use the facial landmark detector STASM to find some important landmarks in
a face image, then, we use the well-known data mining technique, the mRMR algo-

construct three “T” regions in a face image for ethnical feature representation and
prove them to be effective areas for ethnicity recognition. Finally, some extensive
experiments are conducted and the results reveal that the proposed “T” regions
with extracted features are quite effective for ethnical group facial recognition

a European lexifier and Southeast Asian substrates, the development of
‘already’ into a perfective marker is further triggered by the incompatibility

latter. Adopting an ecological approach to language transmission and creole
genesis we discuss how the transient grammaticalization phenomena in the

Kim2019,"How does first-person sensory experience contribute to knowl-
edge? Contrary to the suppositions of early empiricist philoso-
phers, people who are born blind know about phenomena that
cannot be perceived directly, such as color and light. Exactly what
is learned and how remains an open question. We compared
knowledge of animal appearance across congenitally blind (n =
20) and sighted individuals (two groups, n = 20 and n = 35) using
a battery of tasks, including ordering (size and height), sorting
(shape, skin texture, and color), odd-one-out (shape), and feature
choice (texture). On all tested dimensions apart from color, sighted
and blind individuals showed substantial albeit imperfect agree-
ment, suggesting that linguistic communication and visual percep-
tion convey partially redundant appearance information. To test
the hypothesis that blind individuals learn about appearance pri-
marily by remembering sighted people’s descriptions of what they
see (e.g., “elephants are gray”), we measured verbalizability of
animal shape, texture, and color in the sighted. Contrary to the
learn-from-description hypothesis, blind and sighted groups dis-
agreed most about the appearance dimension that was easiest
for sighted people to verbalize: color. Analysis of disagreement
patterns across all tasks suggest that blind individuals infer phys-
ical features from non-appearance properties of animals such as
folk taxonomy and habitat (e.g., bats are textured like mammals
but shaped like birds). These findings suggest that in the absence
of sensory access, structured appearance knowledge is acquired
through inference from ontological kind.","blind people, cognition, animal appearance, folk taxonomy, color terms, "
Willis2019,"This paper introduces the pilot project for the Syntactic Atlas of Welsh Dialects, setting out the
procedures for data collection and sketching a case study for one variable within the dataset,
namely the patterns of negative concord found with the negative modal cau ‘won’t’. This item
is a relatively recent innovation, and it is currently undergoing increasing integration into the
negative concord system. The atlas fieldwork establishes current patterns of dialect variation,
showing significant age variation indicative of change in progress and the rise of negative concord
in this context. On the basis of this, it is argued that the diffuse geographical patterns attested
are best interpreted as evidence of multiple innovation across a wide area, with new speakers
re-implementing the innovation (“multiple reactuation”). A formal analysis is sketched out,
treating the change as moving along a pathway of feature change with semantic features shifting
to interpretable syntactic features and then to uninterpretable syntactic ones. This analysis is
consistent with the dialect patterns and interspeaker implicational hierarchies found in the data.","dialectology, dialect syntax, dialect variation, case study, age variation, language change in progress, "
Hall2017,"The present study investigates the phonology of glides in Middle High German. On the basis
of surface contrasts between prevocalic nuclear glides in syllable-final position ([VG.V]) and
postvocalic glides in onset position ([V.GV]), it is argued that the latter were underlying glides
(e.g. the /w/ in [le.wə] ‘lion’) and that the former were glides derived from vowels (e.g. the ­offglide
[o̯ ] in the diphthong [uo̯ ] from /uo/). Underlying glides are argued to be [+consonantal], while
nuclear glides ‒ like the vowels from which they derive ‒ are [‒consonantal].
The analysis of Middle High German bears on several debates involving glides in the theoretical
literature. First, a treatment with an underlying glide in /VGV/ cannot be reanalyzed by treating
the vowels as peaks (e.g. Harris & Kaisse 1999 for Argentinian Spanish). Second, the treatment
of underlying glides as [+consonantal] is to be preferred over alternatives which analyze those
sounds as [‒vocalic] (e.g. Nevins & Chitoran 2008 for several languages). Third, an analysis of
nuclear structure is adopted (from Harris & Kaisse 1999) which enables one to interpret which
element in a complex nucleus is the peak and which is the nonpeak without stipulation. Fourth,
the contrastive syllabification of surface glides (i.e. [VG.V] vs. [V.GV]) is shown to be a diagnostic
of underlying glide languages that has not been discussed in the literature to date.","syllable peak, prosody, prosodic template, glides, Middle High German, diphthongs, nucleus"
Ling2018,"This study compared the f0, duration and intensity patterns of disyllabic groups that undergo left- or right-dominant tone sandhi in
Shanghai Chinese. We investigated the effects of contrastive focus and speech rate on these patterns, in order to further our
understanding of the nature of left-/right-dominant sandhi and the phonetic realization mechanisms of focus encoding and speech
rate. The results suggest that [Verb+Noun] phrases undergo right-dominant sandhi, which involves a phonetic reduction of the non-final
tone as the f0 contour of σ1 is fully realized in focused or slow speech condition; [Adj.+Noun] compounds undergo left-dominant sandhi,
which consists phonologically of rightward tone spread, since the f0 pattern of compounds is preserved in all conditions. The focus-
induced adjustment patterns of f0, duration and intensity show that left-/right-dominant sandhi domains are composed of different
prosodic structures and focus is indirectly encoded via prosodic structure. Although slow speech and focus both enhance the f0
realization, they are realized by way of different mechanisms. Focus is realized via a speaker's direct control of the intensity, while speech
rate is realized via a speaker's intentional control of the duration, and the f0 adjustment is better regarded as the surface realization or
byproduct of these adjustments.","tone sandhi, Shànghǎi dialect, Shanghainese, case study"
Chabot2019,"The class of rhotics is subject to extensive variation, and a reliable phonetic correlate has
not been found. This variation is also why identifying a segment as a rhotic in an unknown
language is not a trivial matter. In contrast to other phonological classes whose membership is
attributed based on principled criteria, the set of rhotics is arbitrary. This article identifies two
properties independent of phonetics which characterize rhotics cross-linguistically procedural
stability—rhotics that are implicated in phonological processes can vary in a phonetically arbi-
trary manner without perturbing the process itself—and diachronic stability: the phonetics of
rhotics can vary in diachronic evolution without impact on their phonotactics. On the empirical
side the article establishes a cross-linguistic survey of the phonetic variability of rhotics. It is
also argued that the phonetic realization of a rhotic may be unpredictable and divorced from
its ­phonological identity and this shows that languages are happy to instantiate an arbitrary
phonetics-­phonology ­relationship. Finally, it is argued that rhotics show that the interface which
maps phonological objects to their phonetic instantiations is capable of handling an arbitrary
relationship. ­Further, there is no reason to assume that this property of the interface is specific
to rhotics; in ­principle, all phonetic and phonological categories could enter into an arbitrary
relationship. This has ­important implications for theories which seek to impose phonetic or
naturalness based ­constraints on phonology: it is difficult to see how the relationship between
a phonetic object which has no obvious articulatory connection to its phonological represen-
tation could be ­considered phonetically natural. Rhotics thus provide support for the view of
substance-free phonology whereby phonological objects are devoid of any reference to phonetic
categories.","rhotic sounds, definition, typology, sound classes, phonology, phonetics, overview"

inventories of the languages of Eurasia. New measures for studying the importance of
language contact for the development of phonological inventories are proposed, and
two empirical studies are reported. First, using two different measures of dissimilar-
ity of phonemic inventories (the Jaccard dissimilarity measure and the novel Closest-
Relative Cumulative Jaccard Dissimilarity measure), it is demonstrated that language
contact—operationalized as languages being connected by an edge in a neighbor
network—makes a significant contribution to between-inventory differences when
phylogenetic variables are controlled for. Second, a novel measure of the exposure of a
language to a particular segment—the Neighbor-Pressure Metric (NPM)—is proposed
as a means of quantifying language contact with respect to phonological inventories. It
is shown that addition of NPM helps achieve higher prediction accuracy than using bare
phylogenetic data and that distributions of different consonants display a different
degree of dependence on language-contact processes. Finally, more complex models
for predicting consonant inventories are briefly explored, demonstrating the presence
of complex non-linear relationships between inventories of neighboring languages.","geography, sound inventories, database, language in space, Delaney triangulation, contact zone, "

Levin2019,"The nature of the relationship between the head and modifier in Eng-
lish noun compounds has long posed a challenge to semantic theories. We argue
that the type of head-modifier relation in an English endocentric noun-headed
compound depends on how its referent is categorized: specifically, on whether
the referent is conceptualized as an artifact, made by humans for a purpose;
or as a natural kind, existing independently of humans. We propose the Events
vs. Essences Hypothesis: the modifier in an artifact-headed compound typically
refers to an event of use or creation associated with that artifact, while the mod-
ifier in a natural kind-headed compound typically makes reference to inherent
properties reflective of an abstract essence associated with the kind, such as its
perceptual properties or native habitat. We present three studies substantiating
this hypothesis. First, in a corpus of almost 1,700 attested compounds in two con-
ceptual domains (food/cooking and precious minerals/jewelry), we find that as
predicted, compound names referring to artifacts tend to evoke events, whereas
compound names referring to natural kinds tend to evoke essential properties.
Next, in a production experiment involving compound creation and a compre-
hension experiment involving compound interpretation, we find that the same
tendencies also extend to novel compounds.","compounding, partial colexification, semantics, morphology, word formation, conceptualization, "

:translation:`The article discusses the method of obtaining a ranked list of the basic
vocabulary elaborated by Sergei А. Starostin. Unfortunately, as it seems,
the original procedure cannot be completely reproduced. This is mainly due
to the fact that some languages do not preserve the original data in the form
suggested in Starostin’s work. In particular, the Austro-Asiatic base has
undergone significant changes. However, the reconstruction of Starostin’s
procedure shows that in some cases it can be improved. So, firstly, it seems
that a more accurate result is given not by the total number of languages,
but by the number of languages where a given word is present, since
otherwise, if the word is not attested in all the languages, significant
distortions are possible. E.g. in the Austronesian database, the word warm
has a very low stability index because it was attested only in 5 out of 94
languages. Secondly, if one follows the actual ranking method, assigning
different ranks to words with the same stability within the same family, in
case the latter comprises a small number of languages, can significantly
change the ranking order. It seems that when using ranks it is better to
assign the same ranks – in one way or another – to such words.`

Jaeger2011,"@Atkinson<2011>’s article has received considerable public attention and sparked
lively discussion among typologists. In this commentary, we focus on potential
issues with the statistical procedures employed in the paper. In particular,
we investigate to what extent the results are robust once genealogical and ge-

about violations of independence due to the failure to account for relatedness
between languages play a central role in quantitative research on typology (e.g.,
Bell 1978, Dryer 1989, Perkins 1989). We show that the statistical approach
taken by Atkinson, linear mixed effect regression, provides a powerful way to
control for both genealogical and areal dependencies between languages that
has advantages over previous proposals, such as separate regressions by lan-
guage family or by continent or limiting oneself to stratified samples. While
Atkinson (2011) includes only controls for genetic dependencies in his model,
we introduce two simple ways to extend mixed effect models to account for

Schlenker2018b,"While it is now accepted that sign languages should inform and
constrain theories of ‘Universal Grammar’, their role in ‘Universal Semantics’
has been under-studied. We argue that they have a crucial role to play in the
foundations of semantics, for two reasons. First, in some cases sign languages
provide overt evidence on crucial aspects of the Logical Form of sentences, ones
that are only inferred indirectly in spoken language. For instance, sign lan-
guage ‘loci’ are positions in signing space that can arguably realize logical
variables, and the fact that they are overt makes it possible to revisit founda-
tional debates about the syntactic reality of variables, about mechanisms of
temporal and modal anaphora, and about the existence of dynamic binding.
Another example pertains to mechanisms of ‘context shift’, which were postu-
lated on the basis of indirect evidence in spoken language, but which are
arguably overt in sign language. Second, along one dimension sign languages
are strictly more expressive than spoken languages because iconic phenomena
can be found at their logical core. This applies to loci themselves, which may
simultaneously function as logical variables and as schematic pictures of what
they denote (context shift comes with some iconic requirements as well). As a
result, the semantic system of spoken languages can in some respects be seen
as a simplified version of the richer semantics found in sign languages. Two
conclusions could be drawn from this observation. One is that the full extent of
Universal Semantics can only be studied in sign languages. An alternative
possibility is that spoken languages have comparable expressive mechanisms,
but only when co-speech gestures are taken into account (as recently argued
by Goldin-Meadow and Brentari). Either way, sign languages have a crucial
role to play in investigations of the foundations of semantics.","sign language, universal grammar, semantics, linguistic typology, universals, "

Henderson2019,"In addition to roots for familiar classes like verb, noun, and adjective, Mayan languages have
a class of roots traditionally called “positional”. Positional roots are distinct from other roots
most prominently in terms of requiring derivation into stems of one of the more familiar
categories to be used. The goal of this work is to show that the behavior of positionals follows
from ­semantic facts, in particular, the fact that they denote measure functions of type ⟨e,d⟩.
This conclusion is supported through a series of novel arguments from the Mayan language
Kaqchikel that p
­ ositional roots have a scalar semantics. It then argues for the type ⟨e,d⟩ analysis
by ­contrasting them with gradable root adjectives, which similarly make reference to ordered
degrees on a scale, but which have a relational type—namely, ⟨d,et⟩. I then show that a core
function of p
­ ositional morphology, and the morpheme that derives positional stative predicates
in particular, is to take positional roots into stems of type ⟨d,et⟩, which will account for the fact
that derived positionals behave semantically like root adjectives. In this way, this work not only
presents a novel account of the Mayan data, but provide additional evidence for the proposal
that even within languages there can be differences in the fine-grained compositional structure

Jiao2018,"It is often assumed, explicitly or implicitly, that speakers generate special cues in whispered tone and intonation to make up for
the absence of fundamental frequency. The present study examined this assumption with one production and three perception

Mandarin monosyllabic utterances with four lexical tones spoken as either statements or questions. For tones, no acoustic
properties were found to occur only in whispered but not in phonated utterances. For intonation, some spectral tilt measurements
differed between the two phonation types. The two tone perception experiments used phonated and whispered utterances as well as
amplitude-modulated noise based on those utterances as stimuli. Results show that once turned into amplitude-modulated
noise, phonated and whispered tones had similar identification patterns, indicating that the non-F 0 tonal cues in whispers were
already in phonated speech. The intonation perception experiment used original utterances as stimuli and showed a substantial
drop in overall identification rate and an overwhelming bias towards statement. Thus the spectral tilt differences found in the acoustic
analysis were not helpful for intonation perception. Possible reasons for the lack of effective enhancement in whispered speech
were discussed.","whispered speech, Mandarin, phonetics, experimental phonetics, pragmatics"

compositional structure can evolve from the trade-off between learnability and expressivity pressures
at play in language transmission. In the present study we show, across two experiments, how the
same mechanisms involved in the evolution of basic compositionality can also lead to the evolution

transmission allows advantages of compositional hierarchical structure in language learning and use
to permeate language as a system of behaviour.","compositionality, hierarchical structure, language origin, artificial language learning, "

Trait variation is therefore a function of both the phylogenetic and spatial context of species. Here we

species, the spatial occurrences of those units and a phylogeny connecting them. The method modifies the
expected variance of phylogenetically independent contrasts to include both spatial and phylogenetic
effects. We illustrate this approach by analysing cross-species variation in body mass, geographical range
size and species-typical environmental temperature in three orders of mammals (carnivores, artiodactyls
and primates). These species attributes contain highly disparate levels of phylogenetic and spatial signals,
with the strongest phylogenetic autocorrelation in body size and spatial dependence in environmental
temperatures and geographical range size showing mixed effects. The proposed method successfully
captures these differences and in its simplest form estimates a single parameter that quantifies the relative
effects of space and phylogeny. We discuss how the method may be extended to explore a range of models

With time it develops additional meanings («head of state», «head of team»; in some languages also «head of text», i.e., «chapter» etc. etc.). At some point the additional meanings start to «outweigh» the original meaning -- since too much polysemy for a basic word becomes dangerous for the communication process, and the word tends to be replaced by a less polysemantic synonym.

allow some of the gaps in the language to be filled in sound and well-motivated
ways, drawing on the available evidence from the Kaurna sources themselves
and those of neighbouring languages. Where a lexical gap exists, for instance, in
some cases a proto form can be reconstructed for the Yura subgroup of
languages to which Kaurna belongs, and the expected reflex of this proto-form
in Kaurna can be reconstructed. This reconstructed Kaurna reflex may or may
not have actually existed in the Kaurna language. It may well have been part of
the repertoire of speakers in the 1830s and 1840s, but for one reason or another
observers simply failed to record it. Of course it is quite possible that Kaurna
had an entirely different word for the particular concept when compared with
neighbouring languages, there is simply no way of knowing.","language revival, language death, prediction, retrodiction, reflex retrodiction, Kaurna, example"
Knobloch2019,"In this thesis, 9 Indo-Aryan languages which have previously been classified as Shina languages were
analyzed. A cognate analysis of basic vocabulary was conducted, in order to explore the relatedness
of the languages. Furthermore, a selection of phonological, morphological, syntactic, and lexical fea-
tures was analyzed, in order to explore areal patterns among the languages. The data mainly consisted
of first-hand data, which has been collected for the project ”Language contact and relatedness in the
Hindu Kush region”, but even previous descriptions of the languages were used. The results primarily
confirmed hypotheses about the relatedness of the Shina languages, and showed interesting areal pat-
terns. The data also suggested that the Shina languages share many typical features with other Hindu
Kush Indo-Aryan languages, such as SOV word order, the use of postpositions, sex based grammati-
cal gender, and moderately complex to complex syllable structures. Other features, such as aspiration,
retroflexion, and case alignment in noun phrases showed more variation and could certainly be relevant
for future studies on these languages.","Shina, Indo-Aryan languages, typological study, splits networks, feature data"
Anderson2018,"Contrary to what non-practitioners might expect, the systems of phonetic notation used by linguists are highly idiosyncratic. Not only do various linguistic subfields disagree on the specific symbols they use to denote the speech sounds of languages, but also in large databases of sound inventories considerable variation can be found. Inspired by recent efforts to link cross-linguistic data with help of reference catalogues (Glottolog, Concepticon) across different resources, we present initial efforts to link different phonetic notation systems to a catalogue of speech sounds. This is achieved with the help of a database accompanied by a software framework that uses a limited but easily extendable set of non-binary feature values to allow for quick and convenient registration of different transcription systems, while at the same time linking to additional datasets with restricted inventories. Linking different transcription systems enables us to conveniently translate between different phonetic transcription systems, while linking sounds to databases allows users quick access to various kinds of metadata, including feature values, statistics on phoneme inventories, and information on prosody and sound classes. In order to prove the feasibility of this enterprise, we supplement an initial version of our cross-linguistic database of phonetic transcription systems (CLTS), which currently registers five transcription systems and links to fifteen datasets, as well as a web application, which permits users to conveniently test the power of the automatic translation across transcription systems.","dataset, IPA, transcription systems, "

Chaabouni2019,"Despite renewed interest in emergent language simulations with neural networks,
little is known about the basic properties of the induced code, and how they
compare to human language. One fundamental characteristic of the latter, known
as Zipf’s Law of Abbreviation (ZLA), is that more frequent words are efficiently
associated to shorter strings. We study whether the same pattern emerges when two
neural networks, a “speaker” and a “listener”, are trained to play a signaling game.
Surprisingly, we find that networks develop an anti-efficient encoding scheme,
in which the most frequent inputs are associated to the longest messages, and
messages in general are skewed towards the maximum length threshold. This anti-
efficient code appears easier to discriminate for the listener, and, unlike in human
communication, the speaker does not impose a contrasting least-effort pressure
towards brevity. Indeed, when the cost function includes a penalty for longer
messages, the resulting message distribution starts respecting ZLA. Our analysis
stresses the importance of studying the basic features of emergent communication
in a highly controlled setup, to ensure the latter will not strand too far from human
language. Moreover, we present a concrete illustration of how different functional
pressures can lead to successful communication codes that lack basic properties of
human language, thus highlighting the role such pressures play in the latter.","neural networks, language simulation, language emergence, "
Cavique2018,"The comprehension of social network phenomena is closely related to data visualization. However, even with only hundreds
of nodes, the visualization of dense networks is usually difficult. The strategy adopted in this work is data reduction using
communities. Community detection in social network analysis is a very important issue and in particular detection of com-
munity overlapping. In this approach, the information extracted from social networks transcends cohesive groups, enabling
the discovery of brokers that interact among communities. To find admissible solutions in hard problems, relaxed approaches
are used. Quasi-cliques are generated, and partition is found using a partial set-covering heuristic. The proposed method
allows the identification of communities and actors that link two or more groups. In the visualization process, the user can
choose different dimension reduction approaches for the condensed graph. For each condensed structure, a hypergraph can
be drawn, identifying communities and brokers.","graph theory, introduction, hypergraph, community detection, fuzzy clustering, visualization, "

random, but biased toward Kriol variants and innovations. This bias is not explained by simplifi-

complex variants, and, in fact, complex Kriol variants are more likely to be adopted over simpler
Gurindji variants.","Gurindji Kriol, Australian languages, creole languages, creolisation, complexity, lexical borrowing,"

Kretzschmar2018,"In the history of linguistics there have been crucial moments when those of us inter-
ested in language have essentially changed the way we study our subject. We stand
now at such a moment. In this presentation I will review the history of linguistics in
order to highlight some past important changes in the field, and then turn to where
we stand now. Some things that we thought we knew have turned out not to be true,
like the systematic, logical nature of languages. Other things that we had not suspect-
ed, like a universal underlying emergent pattern for all the features of a language, are
now evident. This emergent pattern is fractal, that is, we can observe the same distri-
butional pattern in frequency profiles for linguistic variants at every level of scale in
our analysis. We also have hints that time, as the persistence of a preference for par-
ticular variants of features, is a much more important part of our language than we
had previously believed. We need to explore the new realities of language as we now
understand them, chief among them the idea that patterned variation, not logical sys-
tem, is the central factor in human speech. In order to account for what we now un-
derstand, we need to get used to new methods of study and presentation, and place
new emphasis on different communities and groups of speakers. Because the under-
lying pattern of language is fractal, we need to examine the habits of every group of
speakers at every location for themselves, as opposed to our previous emphasis on
overall grammars. We need to make our studies much more local, as opposed to
global. We do still want to make grammars and to understand language in global
terms, but such generalizations need to follow from what we can now see as the pat-
tern of language as it is actually used.","p-linguistics, discussion, linguistic variation, "

Zhang2019a,"In the brain, the semantic system is thought to store concepts. However, little is known about how it
connects different concepts and infers semantic relations. To address this question, we collected hours
of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from human subjects listening to natural stories.
We developed a predictive model of the voxel-wise response, and further applied it to thousands of new
words. We found that both semantic categories and relations were represented by spatially overlapping
cortical networks, instead of anatomically segregated regions. Importantly, many such semantic
relations that reflected conceptual progression from concreteness to abstractness were represented by
a similar cortical pattern of anti-correlation between the default mode network and the frontoparietal
attention network. Our results suggest that the human brain represents a continuous semantic space
and uses distributed networks to encode not only concepts but also relationships between concepts. In
particular, the default mode network plays a central role in semantic processing for abstraction of
concepts across various domains.","semantic relations, neurolinguistics, "
Alexiadou2019,"The paper investigates two related questions that concern the realization
of plural morphology on nouns across languages. The first question is whether
markedness in the sense of complexity in form goes hand in hand with complex-
ity in meaning. In other words, since plural nouns are formally more complex
than singular nouns, does that mean that they differ in interpretation? On the
basis of experimental and theoretical investigations the claim is supported that
plurals, although morphologically more complex than singulars, are semantically
unmarked across languages. The second question is what regulates the presence
of plural morphology in numeral-noun constructions across languages, in light
of the proposal that plural appears on nouns in such constructions only if it is
semantically unmarked. The paper offers an explanation of this distribution by
adopting a dual system of agreement, which distinguishes between CONCORD
and INDEX features. By looking at these two questions, the paper makes a contri-
bution to the discussion of the relationship between semantic and morphological
markedness.","markedness, overt marking, iconicity, frequency, typology, morphology, semantics"
Fitch2009,"Darwin's ""Origin of Species"" (Darwin, 1859) made little mention of human
evolution. This initial avoidance of human evolution was no oversight, but rather a
carefully calculated move: Darwin was well aware of the widespread resistance his
theory would meet from scientists, clergymen, and the lay public, and mention of
human evolution might have generated insuperable opposition. But Darwin's many
opponents quickly seized on the human mind, and language in particular, as a
potent weapon in the battle against Darwin's new way of thinking. Alfred Wallace,
whose independent discovery of the principle of natural selection spurred Darwin
into finally publishing his long-developing ""outline"" of the theory in 1859, didn't
help by arguing that natural selection was unable to explain the origins of the
human mind. Although Wallace had reservations about all evolutionary approaches
to the mind, human language provided the most powerful argument, due to the
respectable position of linguistics and philology in Victorian science.","ursprache, origin of language, "

Mischke2019,"The Chinese empire experienced a large expansion to the arid regions in
the west during the Han Dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE). The Hexi Corridor, the Yanqi
Basin, the southeastern part of the Junggar Basin and the Tarim Basin became part of
the empire. The expansion of the Han Dynasty was accompanied by the significant
intensification of irrigation farming along rivers draining the Qilian, Tianshan and
Kunlun Mountains. Sedimentological and geochemical analyses and dating of lake
sediments and shorelines revealed that four large lakes in the region experienced
falling levels, or were almost or completely desiccating. The level of Zhuyeze Lake
was falling rapidly ca. 2100 years before present (a BP), and the accumulation of
lake sediments was replaced by an alluvial fan setting in large parts of the basin.
Lake Eastern Juyan desiccated ca. 1700 a BP. Lake Bosten experienced low levels
and increasing salinities at ca. 2200 a BP. Lake sediments in the Lop Nur region were
mostly replaced by aeolian sands during a period of near-desiccation at 1800 a BP.
In contrast, records from fifteen lakes farther in the west, north or south of the Han
Dynasty realm indicate relatively wet climate conditions ca. 2000 years ago. Thus,
dramatic landscape changes including the near and complete desiccation of large lakes in the arid western part of today’s China probably resulted from the withdrawal
of water from tributaries during the Han Dynasty. These changes likely represent the
earliest man-made environmental disasters comparable to the recent Aral-Sea crisis.","Hàn time, climate, irrigation farming, Silk Road, history"

Jacques2019a,"Skepticism regarding the tree model has a long tradition in historical linguistics. Although scholars have emphasized that the tree model and its long-standing counterpart, the wave theory, are not necessarily incompatible, the opinion that family trees are unrealistic and should be completely abandoned in the field of historical linguistics has always enjoyed a certain popularity. This skepticism has further increased with the advent of recently proposed techniques for data visualization which seem to confirm that we can study language history without trees. In this article, we show that the concrete arguments that have been brought up in favor of achronistic wave models do not hold. By comparing the phenomenon of incomplete lineage sorting in biology with processes in linguistics, we show that data which do not seem as though they can be explained using trees can indeed be explained without turning to diffusion as an explanation. At the same time, methodological limits in historical reconstruction might easily lead to an overestimation of regularity, which may in turn appear as conflicting patterns when the researcher is trying to reconstruct a coherent phylogeny. We illustrate how, in several instances, trees can benefit language comparison, although we also discuss their shortcomings in modeling mixed languages. While acknowledging that not all aspects of language history are tree-like, and that integrated models which capture both vertical and lateral language relations may depict language history more realistically than trees do, we conclude that all models claiming that vertical language relations can be completely ignored are essentially wrong: either they still tacitly draw upon family trees or they only provide a static display of data and thus fail to model temporal aspects of language history.

dialect chain break-up, borrowing (both shortly after language splits and

and experimentation. Ethnographies of traditional stone cultures likewise describe group activities
with simple, context-bound interactions embedded in the here and now. Experiments comparing ges-

that process. I conclude that there is no convincing evidence that language played an important role

predictability, etc. An assessment of these and other variables in Icelandic
verbal inflection reveals that most of them are in practice strongly corre-

definitional dependencies holding between those notions. It is empirically
doubtful whether there exists a single underlying phenomenon or category

Braginsky2019,"Why do children learn some words earlier than others? The order in which words are
acquired can provide clues about the mechanisms of word learning. In a large-scale corpus
analysis, we use parent-report data from over 32,000 children to estimate the acquisition
trajectories of around 400 words in each of 10 languages, predicting them on the basis of
independently derived properties of the words’ linguistic environment (from corpora) and
meaning (from adult judgments). We examine the consistency and variability of these
predictors across languages, by lexical category, and over development. The patterning of
predictors across languages is quite similar, suggesting similar processes in operation. In
contrast, the patterning of predictors across different lexical categories is distinct, in line with
theories that posit different factors at play in the acquisition of content words and function
words. By leveraging data at a significantly larger scale than previous work, our analyses
identify candidate generalizations about the processes underlying word learning across
languages.","language acquisition, acquisition, variation, "

Ross2013,"This paper addresses the questions, Do bilingually induced and shift-induced change have differ-
ent outcomes? If they do, can these differences assist us in reconstructing the prehistoric past,
specifically the linguistic prehistory of the (smallscale neolithic) societies of Melanesia.
A key to better interpreting differences in the outputs of contact-induced change is to under-
stand how such change in smallscale societies actually occurs. I argue that it is important to know
the life-stage loci of change. I suggest that language shift has two life-stage loci, one in early
childhood, where evidence of shift, if any, is restricted to specialist lexicon, and one in adult-
hood. Adult language shift appears to have been rare in Melanesia. I also suggest that bilingually
induced change, which entails the syntactic restructuring of one’s heritage language on the
model of a second language, takes place among preadolescent children–a claim which is sup-
ported by various kinds of evidence.
This understanding helps us in turn to interpret the outcomes of contact-induced change and to
infer prehistoric events, since adult second-language learning typically leads to simplification,
whilst childhood language learning may lead to an increase in complexity.","borrowing, language contact, hypothesis, bilingualism, contact-induced language change, "
Alves2018,"This paper evaluates Chinese lexical data in Shorto's @<Shorto>2006 Proto-Mon-Khmer reconstructions to
prevent misapplication of his reconstructions, which in a few dozen instances are based on
problematic data that affect or even refute his reconstructions. First, Shorto notes about 20
Chinese items to consider for their comparable semantic and phonological properties. While
several are probable Chinese loanwords spread throughout the region, a majority of these are
unlikely to be Chinese as they are either Wanderwörter seen in multiple language families with
undetermined origins or, in most cases, simply partial chance similarities, and these latter items
can thus be removed from consideration in Proto-Austroasiatic reconstructions. Second, Shorto
also listed about 50 Vietnamese words as supporting data for proto-Austroasiatic etyma which
are either (a) clearly Sino-Vietnamese readings of Chinese characters (about 20 instances) or (b)
Early Sino-Vietnamese colloquial borrowings (about 30 instances). Many of those proposed
proto-Austroasiatic reconstructions must be reconsidered due to the exclusion of these Sino-
Vietnamese items. While excluding such Sino-Vietnamese or Early Sino-Vietnamese items in
some cases has no impact on those reconstructions, other exclusions result in slight changes in
the reconstructed forms, and in several cases, proposed reconstructions must be entirely
excluded as only Vietnamese and one other branch of Austroasiatic are available as comparative
evidence. Finally, both the exclusions of proposed attestations (and the clarification of their
actual origin) and the hypotheses of regional spread of Chinese words must be considered not
only for Proto-Austroasiatic but also in comparative historical linguistic studies in the region.","Wanderwort, Mon-Khmer, Vietnamese, Sino-Vietnamese borrowings, Proto-Mon-Khmer, Proto-Austroasiatic, Austro-Asiatic, "
Barthel2019,"Speech planning is a sophisticated process. In dialog, it regularly starts in overlap with an
incoming turn by a conversation partner. We show that planning spoken responses in overlap with
incoming turns is associated with higher processing load than planning in silence. In a dialogic
experiment, participants took turns with a confederate describing lists of objects. The confeder-
ate’s utterances (to which participants responded) were pre-recorded and varied in whether they
ended in a verb or an object noun and whether this ending was predictable or not. We found that
response planning in overlap with sentence-final verbs evokes larger task-evoked pupillary
responses, while end predictability had no effect. This finding indicates that planning in overlap
leads to higher processing load for next speakers in dialog and that next speakers do not proac-
tively modulate the time course of their response planning based on their predictions of turn end-
ings. The turn-taking system exerts pressure on the language processing system by pushing
speakers to plan in overlap despite the ensuing increase in processing load.","speech planning, dialog, turn taking, experimental study, "

Blench2004,"The concept of synthesising linguistics, archaeology and genetics in the reconstruction of the past is
becoming a commonplace; but the reality is that each discipline largely pursues its own methods and
what little interaction there is remains marginal. Hence many of the questions asked are internal to
the discipline, addressed to colleagues, not the larger sphere of understanding the past. China and East
Asia in general are a particularly difficult case because so much of the linguistics and archaeology is
driven by an emphasis on high culture. Major archaeological texts refer neither to linguistics nor
genetics and speculation about the identity of non–Chinese groups mentioned in the texts tends to be
unanchored. In addition, ideology surrounding the definition of minorities in China has confused the

Karimi2005,"In this thesis, we present a solution to the problem of discovering rules from sequential
data. As part of the solution, the Temporal Investigation Method for Enregistered Record
Sequences (TIMERS) and its implementation, the TimeSleuth software, are introduced.
TIMERS uses the passage of time between attribute observations as justification for
judging the causality of a rule set. Given a sorted sequence of input data records, and
assuming that the effects take time to manifest themselves, we merge the input records to
bring potential causes and effects together in the same record. Three tests are performed
using three different assumptions on the nature of the relationship: instantaneous, causal,
or acausal. The temporal reversibility of a relationship in time is used to judge the
relationship as potentially acausal, while reversibility is considered as evidence for
judging the relationship as potentially causal. To visualise the attributes’ influence on
each other, the thesis introduces dependence diagrams, which are graphs that connect
condition attributes to decision attributes. We performed a series of comparisons between
TIMERS and other causality discoverers, and also experimented with both synthetic and
real temporal data for the discovery of temporal rules. The results show an improvement
in the quality of the rules discovered with TIMERS.","rule induction, decision tree, causal inference, "
Hubsz2019,"The sequencing of Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes has yielded many new insights
about interbreeding events between extinct hominins and the ancestors of modern
humans. While much attention has been paid to the relatively recent gene flow from
Neanderthals and Denisovans into modern humans, other instances of introgression
leave more subtle genomic evidence and have received less attention. Here, we present
an extended version of the ARGweaver algorithm, ARGweaver-D, which can infer local
genetic relationships under a user-defined demographic model that includes population
splits and migration events. This Bayesian algorithm probabilistically samples ancestral
recombination graphs (ARGs) that specify not only tree topology and branch lengths
along the genome, but also indicate migrant lineages. The sampled ARGs can therefore
be parsed to produce probabilities of introgression along the genome. We show that this
method is well powered to detect the archaic migration into modern humans, even with
only a few samples. We then show that the method can also detect introgressed regions
stemming from older migration events, or from unsampled populations. We apply it to
human, Neanderthal, and Denisovan genomes, looking for signatures of older proposed
migration events, including ancient humans into Neanderthal, and unknown archaic
hominins into Denisovans. We identify 3% of the Neanderthal genome that is putatively
introgressed from ancient humans, and estimate that the gene flow occurred between
200-300kya. We find no convincing evidence that negative selection acted against these
regions. We also identify 1% of the Denisovan genome which was likely introgressed
from an unsequenced hominin ancestor, and note that 15% of these regions have been
passed on to modern humans through subsequent gene flow.","gene flow, character mapping, population genetics, introgression, incomplete lineage sorting, "

Gordon2016,"Phonological typology is concerned with the study of the distribution and behavior
of sounds found in human languages of the world. One thread of typological
research in phonology involves defining the range of cross-linguistic variation and
the relative frequency of phonological patterns. Another line of investigation
attempts to couch these typological observations within theories designed to
model and explain the human knowledge of and capacity to acquire phonological
systems. Both of these research programs require a cross-linguistic database from
which to draw generalizations. They often differ, however, in the ultimate purpose
to which the typological data is put to use, a difference that has consequences for
the methodology employed by the researcher. Because phonological theory dating

cross-linguistic variation, typology has become largely inseparable from most
research in phonology, a close bond that is obvious even in casual inspection of
the phonology literature (Hyman 2007a). Most chapters in recent handbooks of
phonological theory explore particular phonological phenomena, e.g. phoneme
inventories, syllable structure, harmony processes, etc., providing an overview of the
typology of the relevant phenomenon and a summary of theories designed to account
for the range of patterns. One of the current dominant paradigms in phonological
theory, Optimality Theory, is well suited to capturing typological variation since it
employs a set of competing constraints on phonological well-formedness that can be
prioritized differently in different languages (see Chapter 2 for discussion).","typology, phonological typology, cross-linguistic study, "
Zalizniak2018,"The article summarizes the goals and the current state of the Catalogue of sematic shifts (CSSh), its primary
notions being those of a semantic shift, which is understood as a relation of cognitive proximity between
two linguistic meanings, and a realization of a semantic shift, i.e. one polysemic word or a pair of cognate
words of the same language or different languages that act as “exponents” of this relation. The typology
of semantic shifts occupies a position at the crossroad of semantic, lexical and grammatical typologies,
overlapping each of these areas of study in terms of linguistic data and methods used; however, the domain
of CSSh does not coincide with any of them. The framework of CSSh provides the theoretical foundation
for identifying recurring cross-linguistic semantic shifts, and collecting them in the Database of Semantic
Shifts for further analysis. The article demonstrates that the notion of semantic shift as defined in CSSh
is just a formalization of an instrument of linguistic analysis that is already quite common in various
areas of linguistics. Semantic shift provides a basis for the notion of semantic parallel used in the historical
linguistics and etymology, for motivational models in word-formation, it is a central notion for grammati-
calization theory; finally, semantic shift is one of various types of implicit meanings (along with
presuppositions and connotations) that shape the “linguistic model of the world”. Linguistic data contained
in the Database of Semantic Shifts can be used in all these areas, in order to provide semantic plausibility
criteria for linguistic reconstruction, to act as empirical evidence for cognitive mechanisms of linguistic
conceptualization, to aid in identifying specific features of the semantic system of a given language or

Ariel2012,"Two major obstacles
blocked the attempts to come up with a coherent definition for pragmatics.
First, there was the hope that a multiplicity of criteria simultaneously con-
verge to distinguish between all of grammar (including semantics) and all of
pragmatics, e.g., context sensitivity, non-truth-conditionality, implicitness,
discourse scope (and many others), all characterizing pragmatics, and con-
text invariability, truth-conditionality, explicitness, sentential scope (and
many others), all characterizing grammar. Naturally, the more criteria we
can mobilize for drawing the grammar/pragmatics division of labor, the
more contentful each of the defined domains is made out to be, and the
more significant the distinction between them. 

The second high hope was
that complete topics, such as speech acts, implicatures, politeness, functional
syntax, deixis, presupposition, agreement, and argument structure each, en
bloc, belongs either in grammar or in pragmatics. Indeed, this would guar-
antee a very neat division of labor between grammar and pragmatics. Thus,
speech acts, implicatures, politeness, and functional syntax should wholly
belong on the pragmatics turf, agreement and argument structure should
wholly belong on the grammatical turf, and semanticists and pragmatists
should do battle over, e.g., presupposition and deixis. 

Unfortunately, neither one of these worthy goals can be achieved. Multi-
ple criteria for distinguishing grammar and pragmatics resulted in multiple
contradictions between the various criteria, which render the definitions of
both grammar and pragmatics incoherent.","pragmatics, definition, overview"

inflectional morphology and the lexicon can be adduced to illustrate
these problems.

Traditional subgrouping tends to rely on phonology because
phonemic mergers are clearly innovations. But though the set of
sound changes in each line of descent is unique, the individual
changes are usually so `natural' that they can easily be repeated in
dierent lines of descent; that is, they are the products of phonetic
pressures that operate in all languages and frequently give the same
results in cases widely separated in space and time. That is true
whether one states the changes in phonetic or phonemic terms.","subgrouping, problem, cladistics, homoplasy"

List2014d,"Both the UPGMA algorithm and the Neighbor-Joining algorithm produce
evolutionary trees from distance data and their original purpose is to explain
observed distances between a set of taxonomic units (species, genomes) as
an evolutionary process of split and divergence. The amount of divergence is
displayed by the branch lengths of the evolutionary tree. Conceptually, both
algorithms are quite different. UPGMA assumes that the distances are ultrametric. This means that evolutionary change should be constant along all
branches of the tree. Divergence (as represented by the branch lengths) re-
ceives a direct temporal interpretation: UPGMA trees have a definite root,
and all leaves (terminal nodes) have the same distance to it (@Peer<2009> 2009: 144).
If the observed distances between the taxonomic units can be interpreted in
such a way, UPGMA will produce a tree which directly reflects the distance [pb] matrix: The sum of the branch lengths connecting any two taxa will be the

With the hypothesis confirmed, we examine the input and output of such sound changes in terms of manner and place of articulation and find that while decrease in oral constriction (weakening) affects most consonant types, increase in oral constriction (strengthening) is largely restricted to palatal and labial glides. We conclude that strengthening does not appear to be the simple inverse of weakening. In conclusion we suggest some possible avenues for explaining how glide strengthening may result from articulatory production pressures and speculate that strengthening and weakening can be encompassed under a single theory of sound change resulting from the automatization of production.","missing code, missing data, phoneme inventory, lenition, fortition, sound change, "
Raviv2019,"Understanding worldwide patterns of language diversity has long been agoal for evolutionary scientists, linguists and philosophers. Research overthe past decade has suggested that linguistic diversity may result fromdifferences in the social environments in which languages evolve. Specifi-cally, recent work found that languages spoken in larger communitiestypically have more systematic grammatical structures. However, in thereal world, community size is confounded with other social factors suchas network structure and the number of second languages learners in thecommunity, and it is often assumed that linguistic simplification is drivenby these factors instead. Here, we show that in contrast to previous assump-tions, community size has a unique and important influence on linguisticstructure. We experimentally examine the live formation of new languagescreated in the laboratory by small and larger groups, and find that largergroups of interacting participants develop more systematic languages overtime, and do so faster and more consistently than small groups. Smallgroups also vary more in their linguistic behaviours, suggesting that smallcommunities are more vulnerable to drift. These results show that commu-nity size predicts patterns of language diversity, and suggest that an increasein community size might have contributed to language evolution.","community size, community structure, linguistic complexity, artificial language learning, experimental study, "

Kraemer2019,"Human mobility is an important driver of geographic spread of infectious pathogens. Detailed information about human movements during outbreaks are, however, difficult to obtain and may not be available during future epidemics. The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa between 2014–16 demonstrated how quickly pathogens can spread to large urban centers following one cross-species transmission event. Here we describe a flexible transmission model to test the utility of generalised human movement models in estimating EVD cases and spatial spread over the course of the outbreak. A transmission model that includes a general model of human mobility significantly improves prediction of EVD’s incidence compared to models without this component. Human movement plays an important role not only to ignite the epidemic in locations previously disease free, but over the course of the entire epidemic. We also demonstrate important differences between countries in population mixing and the improved prediction attributable to movement metrics. Given their relative rareness, locally derived mobility data are unlikely to exist in advance of future epidemics or pandemics. Our findings show that transmission patterns derived from general human movement models can improve forecasts of spatio-temporal transmission patterns in places where local mobility data is unavailable.","disease spread, human mobility, spatial modeling, geographic models, "

Ross2013,"One of very few variationist studies of smallscale dialect contact is James
Stanford’s work on Sui, a Kadai language of Guizhou Province in SE China.
Each Sui village has its own clanlect, which is spoken by men and unmarried
women. Marriage normally involves partners from different villages, and the
wife relocates to her husband’s village. As a result, husband and wife often
speak different clanlects. @Stanford<2008> (2008b) investigated whether the wives
accommodated to the clanlect of their new village, and found that they don’t:
they retain their native clanlect. The Sui place strong value on the clanlect and
on its retention, and women who accommodate to their husband’s clanlect are
objects of ridicule. This contradicts the standard claim that speakers always
accommodate to the dialect spoken around them. But the interesting thing is
what happens to Sui children. Young children inevitably acquire features of
Mum’s clanlect, but this gives way quite quickly to Dad’s lect—the lect of the
village—as Mum’s clanlect invites ridicule. Children as young as three already
speak Dad’s lect, but with interferences from Mum’s lect, and even adolescents
of 15-16 may still produce Mum’s version of a lexical item (Stanford 2008a,

We treat the problem of estimating ancestral trees with time depth from binary trait data. Simple
analysis of such data is problematic. Each homology class of traits has a unique birth event on
the tree, and the birth event of a trait that is visible at the leaves is biased towards the leaves.
We propose a model-based analysis of such data and present a Markov chain Monte Carlo
algorithm that can sample from the resulting posterior distribution. Our model is based on using
a birth–death process for the evolution of the elements of sets of traits. Our analysis correctly
accounts for the removal of singleton traits, which are commonly discarded in real data sets.
We illustrate Bayesian inference for two binary trait data sets which arise in historical linguistics.
The Bayesian approach allows for the incorporation of information from ancestral languages.
The marginal prior distribution of the root time is uniform. We present a thorough analysis of
the robustness of our results to model misspecification, through analysis of predictive distribu-

in a way that depends on both the trait and the missing data content. Nicholls and Gray treated
missing records as absent traits. Hittite has 12% missing trait records. Its age is poorly predicted
in their cross-validation. Our prediction is consistent with the historical record. Nicholls and Gray
dropped seven languages with too much missing data. We fit all 24 languages in the lexical data
of Ringe and co-workers. To model spatiotemporal rate heterogeneity we add a catastrophe
process to the model. When a language passes through a catastrophe, many traits change at
the same time. We fit the full model in a Bayesian setting, via Markov chain Monte Carlo sam-
pling. We validate our fit by using Bayes factors to test known age constraints. We reject three
of 30 historically attested constraints. Our main result is a unimodal posterior distribution for the

Old Chinese, Late Middle Chinese (represented by the language of The Record of Linji), and

correlate with other similar observed situations, e.g. for the Greek language, though not with
others (Icelandic). It is hoped that future similar studies on the lexical evolution of languages

Dacrema2019,"Different factors contribute to such phenomena, including (i) weak baselines; (ii) establishment of weak methods as new base-lines; and (iii) difficulties in comparing or reproducing results across papers. One first problem lies in the choice of the baselines that are used in the comparisons. Sometimes, baselines are chosen that are too weak in general for the given task and dataset, and some-times the baselines are not properly fine-tuned. Other times, base-lines are chosen from the same family as the newly proposed algorithm, e.g., when a new deep learning algorithm is compared only against other deep learning baselines. This behaviour enforces the propagation of weak baselines. When previous deep learning algorithms were evaluated against too weak baselines, the new deep learning algorithm will not necessarily improve over strong non-neural baselines. Furthermore, with the constant flow of papers being published in recent years, keeping track of what represents a state-of-the-art baseline becomes increasingly challenging.","baseline, methodology, evaluation, neural networks, machine learning, "

Schlenker2016,"We argue that rich data gathered in experimental primatology in the last
40 years can benefit from analytical methods used in contemporary linguistics.
Focusing on the syntactic and especially semantic side, we suggest that these methods could help clarify five questions: (i) what morphology and syntax, if any,
do monkey calls have? (ii) what is the ‘lexical meaning’ of individual calls? (iii)
how are the meanings of individual calls combined? (iv) how do calls or call
sequences compete with each other when several are appropriate in a given
situation? (v) how did the form and meaning of calls evolve? We address these
questions in five case studies pertaining to cercopithecines (Putty-nosed monkeys,
Blue monkeys, and Campbell’s monkeys), colobinae (Guereza monkeys and King
Colobus monkeys), and New World monkeys (Titi monkeys). The morphology
mostly involves simple calls, but in at least one case (Campbell’s -oo) we find a
root-suffix structure, possibly with a compositional semantics. The syntax is in all
clear cases simple and finite-state. With respect to meaning, nearly all cases of call
concatenation can be analyzed as conjunction. But a key question concerns the
division of labor between semantics, pragmatics and the environmental context
(‘world’ knowledge and context change). An apparent case of dialectal variation
in the semantics (Campbell’s krak) can arguably be analyzed away if one posits
sufficiently powerful mechanisms of competition among calls, akin to scalar
implicatures. An apparent case of non-compositionality (Putty-nosed pyow-hack
sequences) can be analyzed away if one further posits a pragmatic principle of
‘urgency’, whereby threat-related calls must come early in sequences (another
potential case of non-compositionality – Colobus snort-roar sequences – might
justify assigning non-compositional meanings to complex calls, but results are
tentative). Finally, rich Titi sequences in which two calls are re-arranged in com-
plex ways so as to reflect information about both predator identity and location are
argued not to involve a complex syntax/semantics interface, but rather a fine-
grained interaction between simple call meanings and the environmental context.
With respect to call evolution, we suggest that the remarkable preservation of call
form and function over millions of years should make it possible to lay the
groundwork for an evolutionary monkey linguistics, which we illustrate with cerco-
pithecine booms, and with a comparative analysis of Blue monkey and Putty-nosed
monkey repertoires. Throughout, we aim to compare possible theories rather than
to fully adjudicate between them, and our claims are correspondingly modest. But
we hope that our methods could lay the groundwork for a formal monkey linguistics
combining data from primatology with formal techniques from linguistics (from
which it does not follow that the calls under study share non-trivial properties, let
alone an evolutionary history, with human language).","animal linguistics, animal language, language evolution, origin of language, animal calls, monkey calls, monkeys"

between the literal meaning of monkey calls, additional mechanisms of prag-

Lalo less frequently. Tonal range in elicited speech is shown to be decreasing
as use of Lalo decreases. Concurrently, the standard deviation of the pitch of
individual tones also decreases, while at the same time speakers with a nar-
row tonal range also show greater articulatory precision for each tone. Tonal
range and standard deviation of pitch are both parameters of tonal space,
the arrangement of, and relationship between, tones within the tonal sys-

Kawahara2019,"Sound symbolism refers to stochastic and systematic associations between sounds and meanings.
Sound symbolism has not received much serious attention in the generative phonology literature, perhaps
because most if not all sound symbolic patterns are probabilistic. Building on the recent proposal to analyze
sound symbolic patterns within a formal phonological framework (Alderete and Kochetov 2017), this paper
shows that MaxEnt grammars allow us to model stochastic sound symbolic patterns in a very natural way.
The analyses presented in the paper show that sound symbolic relationships can be modeled in the same
way that we model phonological patterns. We suggest that there is nothing fundamental that prohibits formal
phonologists from analyzing sound symbolic patterns, and that studying sound symbolism using a formal
framework may open up a new, interesting research domain. The current study also reports two hitherto
unnoticed cases of sound symbolism, thereby expanding the empirical scope of sound symbolic patterns in

Givon1989,"Pragmatics is an approach to description, to information processing, thus to
the construction, interpretation and comm unication of experience. At its core
lies the notion of context, and the axiom that reality and/or experience are not
absolute fixed entities, but rather frame-dependent, contingent upon the ob-
server's perspective.

Pragmatics traces its illustrious ancestry to the pre-Socratic Greek dialec-
ticians, then via Aristotle to Locke, Kant and Peirce, eventually to 19th Century
phenomenologists, and--Iast but not least--to Ludw ig Wittgenstein. In cogni-
tive psychology, pragmatics underlies figure-ground perception, primed
storage and maleable recall, attended ('context-scanning') information
processing, and flexible ('prototype') categorization. In linguistics, prag-
matics animates the study of contextual meaning and metaphoric extension,
frame semantics and the semeiotics of grammar-in-discourse, the sociology
of language, and the acquisition of communicative competence. In anthropol-
ogy, pragmatics is reflected in the exploration of cultural relativity, ethno-
methodology and cross-cultural cognition.

In spite of such exalted lineage and wide applicability, the academic study
of pragmatics remains narrow, insular and fractious. On the one hand,
various formal schools have undertaken to keep pragmatics firmly attached
to the very discipline which it purported to overthrow--formal deductive
logic. On the other hand, a plethora of informal schools have taken the
intoxicating freedom of contextual relativity as license for extreme
methodological nihilism, unfettered intuitionism, and an anything goes rejec-
tion of sensible em pirical constraints. What unites these extrem e in terpreta-
tions is, paradoxically, an antipragmatic faith in the Platonic excluded middle:
The lack oftotal order means a total lack oforder; the lack oftotal understanding is a
total lack of understanding. In this way, the very essence of pragmatics is
subverted by its most impassioned proponents.
academics all too often ignore--that Goedel's observed limits on systems--
neither fully consistent, nor ever complete--sum up rather well the pragmatic
predicament of life and mind in a real environment.

Pragmatics, at its somewhat unadorned middle-ground best, closely reflects
the evolutionary compromise practiced by biological organisms. In adapting
to life in a less-than-ideal environment, bio-organisms have invariably opted
for the proposition that half a loaf is infinitely better than none; that life is
precariously suspended mid-way between absolute order and unmitigated
chaos; that while full determinism is a dangerous evolutionary trap, un-
bounded freedom is an unrealistic evolutionary mirage. In their h u mble

Maliet2019,"Understanding how and why diversification rates vary through time and space and across species groups is key to understand-
ing the emergence of today’s biodiversity. Phylogenetic approaches aimed at identifying variations in diversification rates dur-
ing the evolutionary history of clades have focused on exceptional shifts subtending evolutionary radiations. While such shifts
have undoubtedly affected the history of life, identifying smaller but more frequent changes is important as well. We developed
ClaDS—a new Bayesian approach for estimating branch-specific diversification rates on a phylogeny that relies on a model with
changes in diversification rates at each speciation event. We show, using Monte Carlo simulations, that the approach performs
well at inferring both small and large changes in diversification. Applying our approach to bird phylogenies covering the entire

Manni2019,"Gabon is an African country located very close to the homeland of Bantu languages

nunciation of 88 and 158 words in more than 50 linguistic varieties spoken in Gabon, we
obtain a numerical classification of the major linguistic groups. We compare this classifi-

temporally ordered observations. Our solution is based on generating and interpreting a set of temporal
decision rules. A temporal decision rule is a decision rule that can be used to predict or retrodict the value of a
decision attribute, using condition attributes that are observed at times other than the decision attribute’s time
of observation. A rule set, consisting of a set of temporal decision rules with the same decision attribute, can be
interpreted by our Temporal Investigation Method for Enregistered Record Sequences (TIMERS) to signify an
instantaneous, an acausal or a possibly causal relationship between the condition attributes and the decision
attribute. We show the effectiveness of our method, by describing a number of experiments with both synthetic

western part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The study examines the interaction be-
tween these languages and seven neighboring Ubangian languages (gbánzírí, g bú, ma ó,

determines the degree of lexical similarity between the languages under study, a phylogenetic
classification has been established which integrates these languages in the larger sample of 401
Bantu languages used by Grollemund et al. (2015). This quantitative approach has generated
Neighbor-Net and Neighbor-Joining networks as well as Bayesian trees, which indicate the in-
ternal sub-groups of the Bantu family in general, and more specifically of the Bantu languages
of the central Congo basin to which the Bantu languages spoken between the Congo and Ubangi
Rivers belong. Subsequently, we have undertaken a descriptive and comparative study of the those
languages as well as a study of regular sound correspondances with regard to Proto-Bantu. They
possess certain foreign phonemes that have not been reconstructed to Proto-Bantu, such as im-
plosives and labiovelar stops, which have the status of distinct phonemes. The study of these spe-
cific sounds suggests that they were borrowed from the neighboring Ubangian languages. The
lexical comparison also revealed an interaction between Bantu and Ubangian languages. Certain
lexical borrowings were transferred from Bantu to Ubangian, while others moved in the opposite
direction. Through the comparative method, we have obtained a phonological reconstruction of
the hypothetical ancestor language of these langues. This Proto-Congo-Ubangi Bantu split into

Ma2019,"Tibetan pig is native to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and has adapted to the high-altitude environmental
condition such as hypoxia. However, its origin and genetic mechanisms underlying high-altitude
adaptation still remain controversial and enigmatic. Herein, we analyze 229 genomes of wild and

Phylogenomic and structure analyses show that Tibetan pigs have a close relationship with low-land
domestic pigs in China, implying a common domestication origin. Positively selected genes in Tibetan
pigs involved in high-altitude physiology, such as hypoxia, cardiovascular systems, UV damage, DNA

CYP4F2 showing reduced transcriptional activity in Tibetan pigs. A high-frequency missense mutation
is found in THSD7A (Lys561Arg) in Tibetan pigs. The selective sweeps in Tibetan pigs was found in
association with selection against non-coding variants, indicating an important role of regulatory

We demonstrate a method for quantifying the strength of this connection in terms of the ‘basic reproductive ratio’ of linguistic constituents. It represents a standardized measure of reproductive success, which can be derived both from diachronic and from acquisition data. By analyzing phonotactic English data, we show that the results of both types of derivation correlate, so that phonotactic acquisition indeed predicts phonotactic change, and vice versa. After drawing that general conclusion, we discuss the role of utterance frequency and show that the latter exhibits destabilizing effects only on late acquired items, which belong to phonotactic periphery. We conclude that – at least in the evolution of English phonotactics – acquisition serves conservation, while innovation is more likely to occur in adult speech and affects items that are less entrenched but comparably frequent.","language acquisition, language change, basic reproductive ratio, reasons for language change, "

We developed a predictive model of the voxel-wise response, and further applied it to thousands of new
words. We found that both semantic categories and relations were represented by spatially overlapping
cortical networks, instead of anatomically segregated regions. Importantly, many such semantic
relations that reflected conceptual progression from concreteness to abstractness were represented by
a similar cortical pattern of anti-correlation between the default mode network and the frontoparietal
attention network. Our results suggest that the human brain represents a continuous semantic space
and uses distributed networks to encode not only concepts but also relationships between concepts. In
particular, the default mode network plays a central role in semantic processing for abstraction of
concepts across various domains.","human brain, semantic space, concepts, cortical representations, neurolinguistics, "

Levinson2010,"This paper argues that the language sciences are on the brink of major changes in primary
data, methods and theory. Reactions to ‘The myth of language universals’ (Evans and
Levinson, 2009a,b) divide in response to these new challenges. Chomskyan-inspired ‘C-
linguists’ defend a status quo, based on intuitive data and disparate universalizing abstract
frameworks, reflecting 30 years of changing models. Linguists driven by interests in richer
data and linguistic diversity, ‘D-linguists’, though more responsive to the new
developments, have tended to lack an integrating framework. Here we outline such an
integrative framework of the kind we were presupposing in ‘Myth’, namely a
coevolutionary model of the interaction between mind and cultural linguistic traditions
which puts variation central at all levels – a model that offers the right kind of response to
the new challenges. In doing so we traverse the fundamental questions raised by the
commentary in this special issue: What constitutes the data, what is the place of formal
representations, how should linguistic comparison be done, what counts as explanation,
what is the source of design in language?

Radical changes in data, methods and theory are upon us. The future of the discipline
will depend on responses to these changes: either the field turns in on itself and atrophies,
or it modernizes, and tries to capitalize on the way language lies at the intersection of all
the disciplines interested in human nature.","quantitative turn, linguistics, opinion paper, "

Trask1996,"At present there are some 6000 different languages spoken on our planet, and every one of these languages has a vocabulary containing many thousands of words. Moreover, speakers of every one of these languages are in contact with [pb]
neighbors who speak different languages; this is true today even for people living on remote Pacific islands on which they had previously been isolated for centuries. Consequently, everybody is in a position to learn some of the words used by their neighbours, and very frequently people take a liking to some of their neighbours' words and take those words over into their own language.

Trask1996,"All languages borrow words, but it is notable that some types of words are borrowed more readily than others.
For one thing, nouns are borrowed more often than verbs or adjectives. This occurs partly because nouns are far more numerous than other classes of words to begin with, partly because new things are more likely to be denoted by nouns than by other words, and partly because new nouns are often easier to accommodate within the grammatical system of the borrowing language.","borrowability, hypothesis, reasons for borrowing, borrowing"
Trask1996,"Further, there is clear evidence that certain semantic classes of words are much less likely to be borrowed than other words. These are chiefly the items of very high frequency which we would expect to find in every language: pronouns, lower numerals, kinship terms, names of body parts, simple verbs like *go*, *be*, *have*, *want*, *see*, *eat*, and *die*, widespread colour terms like *black*, *white*, and *red*, simple adjectives like *big*, *small*, *good*, *bad*, and *old*, names of natural phenomena like *sun*, *moon*, *star*, *fire*, *rain*, *river*, *snow*, *day*, and *night*.,grammatical words like *when*, *here*, *and*, *if*, and *this*, and a few others.
Such words are often called the basic vocabulary, and the fact that they are rarely borrowed makes them of considerable importance in historical linguistics, as we will see later in the book.","borrowing, borrowability, basic vocabulary, "
Trask1996,"Broadly speaking, there are two ways of dealing with this problem. First, if you ahve some idea how the word is pronounced in the donor language, you can try your best to reproduce that pronunciation in your own language, producing as a result something which is conspicuously foreign. Second, you can abandon such efforts and just pronounce the loan word as though it were a native word, following the ordinary phonological patterns of your language, and as a result changing the original pronunciation of the word, perhaps greatly. Both these approaches are widely used.","loan word, loanword integration, loan adaptation, borrowing"

Trask1996,"In some cases, centuries of contact between languages can lead to a particularly striking result: several neighbouring but unrelated languages can come to share a number of structural properties with one another, properties which they do not share with their closest genetic relatives elsewhere. A group of languages in which this situation obtains is called a linguistic area, or, using the German term, a *Sprachbund*. 
A number of such linguistic areas have been identified: the Balkans, theIndian subcontinent, southern Africa, the north-west coast of North America, southeast Asia, and several others. ","Sprachbund, linguistic area, examples"
Trask1996,"Southeast Asia is a case in point. Such languages as Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai, Burmese, and the Miao-Yao languages all have tones, and they all have monosyllabic morphemes (and often monosyllabic words). Their closest relatives elsewhere, such as Tibetan, a fairly close relative of Burmese, generally lack these characteristics (though some dialects of Tibetan have acquired tones very recently). Indeed, so distinctive are these languages that it was formerly thought they must all be related, a vew now known to be false, and identifying the true relatives of these languages has proved to be an exceedingly difficult problem, because all of these languages look far more like one another than they do like their relatives, the more so since Chinese loan words have penetrated deeply into most of the neighbouring languages. In this particular case, it is often though that the convergence among these unrelated languages is chiefly the result of heavy influence from the prestigious Chinese, but no on really knows.","South-East Asia, linguistic area, "

Bensalem2019,"When a shift in writing style is noticed in a document, doubts arise about
its originality. Based on this clue to plagiarism, the intrinsic approach to plagiarism
detection identifies the stolen passages by analysing the writing style of the sus-
picious document without comparing it to textual resources that may serve as
sources for the plagiarist. Character n-grams are recognised as a successful approach
to modelling text for writing style analysis. Although prior studies have investigated
the best practice of using character n-grams in authorship attribution and other
problems, there is still a need for such investigations in the context of intrinsic
plagiarism detection. Moreover, it has been assumed in previous works that the
ways of using character n-grams in authorship attribution remain the same for
intrinsic plagiarism detection. In this paper, we study the effect of character n-grams
frequency and length on the performance of intrinsic plagiarism detection. Our
experiments utilise two state-of-the-art methods and five large document collections
of PAN labs written in English and Arabic. We demonstrate empirically that the low- and the high-frequency n-grams are not equally relevant for intrinsic plagia-

Blench2019,"The Sino-Tibetan [Trans-Himalayan] language phylum consists of large number of independent branches
with no agreed internal structure. It is usually characterised as sesquisyllabic, i.e. typical word forms,
especially nominals, have one or more presyllables and a root, the presyllable consisting of a single
consonant. Such a structure, which is globally rare, also characterises almost all branches of Austroasiatic,
the phylum with which it is intertwined across the central part of its range. However, the incidence of
sesquisyllabism is sporadic in Sino-Tibetan, characterising east-central laguages and being absent in the
diverse languages in the west of its range, typically in Nepal. In the easternmost Sino-Tibetan languages the
trend towards monosyllabism has all but eliminated sesquisyllabism. The paper argues that sesquisyllabic
structures are a consequence of the interaction with Austroasiatic and not an underlying characteristic of the
phylum. The presence or absence of these structures is tabulated and mapped in each potential branch of
Sino-Tibetan, to demonstrate their geography and the overlap with Austroasiatic. It is underlined that if this
argument is accepted, then the whole process of reconstruction of PST, which in many cases hangs on the
citation of a very few languages, is unreliable and the pathways to the proto-language must be radically
rethought.","sesqui-syllabic structure, Sino-Tibetan, critic, linguistic reconstruction, language contact,"
Daland2019,"Loanword adaptation has been claimed to provide a unique window onto
the relation between speech perception and the phonological grammar. This paper
focuses on whether the ‘illusory vowel’ effect—in which the presence/absence of a
vowel is poorly discriminated within an illicit cluster—is sufficient to explain why
vowel epenthesis is the preferred repair for medial clusters in Korean loanword adap-
tation. A cross-linguistic discrimination experiment revealed a causative role of the
stop release burst (or other audible frication noise) in the perception of an illusory
vowel; in some cases, perception alone explains vowel epenthesis in loanword adap-
tation. A follow-up, identification experiment showed that Koreans’ perceptual simi-
larity judgements do not match up with the adaptation pattern for stop-nasal clusters
(e.g. pakna), although they do for fricative-stop and stop-stop clusters (e.g. paska,
pakta). This finding is problematic for a purely perceptual account of loanword adap-
tation. The paper sketches a Bayesian account of Korean speech perception that in-
tegrates top-down phonotactic likelihood and bottom-up acoustic match and is able
to explain the experimental results. It closes with some speculation on the role of the
Preservation Principle versus perception in loanword adaptation.","loanword integration, Korean, p-linguistics, "

Heggarty2017,"When looking to language data as a source of information on human (pre)history,
linguistic areas have long been the very poor relation of language families. Both
within linguistics, and in conjunction with archaeology and genetics, far less atten-
tion has been paid to convergence areas than to diverging families. Yet human
populations have inevitably interacted in complexes of both convergent and diver-
gent processes. This holds in linguistics no less than in culture and genetics: witness
Matisoff’s (1990: 113) “Sinosphere” vs. “Indosphere”, two contrasting areal con-
vergence zones, but within the same diverging Tibeto-Burman family. This imbal-
ance between families and areas distorts and diminishes what we can learn from
comparative linguistics, both historical and typological. It also means that we have
much to gain if we can rebalance, to look much more seriously at the real-world
contexts through (pre)history in which linguistic areas arose.

Archaeologists and geneticists, when faced with signals of convergence between
human populations on the sociocultural and demographic levels, often still think
only in terms of divergent families as the linguistic parallel — rather than the more
natural fit with convergent areas, so little known outside linguistics. Linguistics,
meanwhile, labours under its own misconceptions and outdated visions of other
disciplines, in the balance between migratory and diffusionist interpretations of the
human past. Explaining linguistic areas requires one to think in terms of demo-
graphic and socio-cultural processes radically different to those traditionally invoked
to account for language family expansions. Or indeed, to rethink whether certain
contexts and processes — trade, mobility, and so on — are good explanations for
divergent families at all, when in fact they can be more plausible shapers of linguis-
tic convergence areas instead.

This contribution aims to set out some general first principles for a prehistory of
language areas. These principles will be illustrated by cases drawn from a range
of (pre)historic contexts from across the globe: Meso-America, the Andes and
Amazonia, the Balkans, mainland south-east Asia, and the ‘Altaic’ zone of north-
eastern Asia.","language contact, convergence, linguistic area, Sprachbund, language union, South-East Asia, Meso-America, Andes, Amazonia, Altaic, Balkan"

to the next dimension of the global linguistic panorama, informative of

convergence areas. For those areas are effectively defined as aggregations
of what has just been discussed: multiple structural features that overlap in
their geographical distributions. The presence of highly complex tonal sys-
tems, for instance, is one of a set of key shared characteristics that together
define the linguistic area of (mainland) South-East Asia. (Others include
tendencies also towards isolating morphology, monosyllabic morphemes,

Rau2019,"On the basis of historical linguistic and language geographic evidence, the authors advance the novel hypothesis that the Munda languages originated on the east coast of India after their Austroasiatic precursor arrived via a maritime route from Southeast Asia, 3,500 to 4,000 years ago. Based on the linguistic evidence, we argue that pre-Proto-Munda arose in Mainland Southeast Asia after the spread of rice agriculture in the late Neolithic period, sometime after 4,500 years ago. A small Austroasiatic population then brought pre-Proto-Munda by means of a maritime route across the Bay of Bengal to the Mahanadi Delta region – an important hub location for maritime trade in historic and pre-historic times. The interaction with a local South Asian population gave rise to proto-Munda and the Munda branch of Austroasiatic. The Maritime Hypothesis accounts for the linguistic evidence better than other scenarios such as an Indian origin of Austroasiatic or a migration from Southeast Asia through the Brahmaputra basin. The available evidence from archaeology and genetics further supports the hypothesis of a small founder population of Austroasiatic speakers arriving in Odisha from Southeast Asia before the Aryan conquest in the Iron-Age.","Munda, Austroasiatic, homeland, dating"

left by the source languages. However, just like it is a thorny problem to separate semantic from
syntactic similarity in word representations, it is not obvious what type of similarity is cap-

language representations learned from translations on one hand, and genetic, geographical,
and several levels of structural similarity between languages on the other. Of these, structural
similarity is found to correlate most strongly with language representation similarity, while
genetic relationships—a convenient benchmark used for evaluation in previous work—appears
to be a confounding factor. Apart from implications about translation effects, we see this more
generally as a case where NLP and linguistic typology can interact and benefit one another.","structural similarity, genetic similarity, language representations, neural network, "
Legendre2015,"1. The Mantel test is widely used in biology, including landscape ecology and genetics, to detect spatial structures
in data or control for spatial correlation in the relationship between two data sets, for example community
composition and environment. The study demonstrates that this is an incorrect use of that test.

2. The null hypothesis of the Mantel test differs from that of correlation analysis; the statistics computed in the
two types of analyses differ. We examined the basic assumptions of the Mantel test in spatial analysis and showed
that they are not verified in most studies. We showed the consequences, in terms of power, of the mismatch
between these assumptions and the Mantel testing procedure.

3. The Mantel test H 0 is the absence of relationship between values in two dissimilarity matrices, not the indepen-
dence between two random variables or data tables. The Mantel R 2 differs from the R 2 of correlation, regression
and canonical analysis; these two statistics cannot be reduced to one another. Using simulated data, we show that
in spatial analysis, the assumptions of linearity and homoscedasticity of the Mantel test (H 1 : small values of D 1

when spatial correlation extends over the whole study area. Using extensive simulations of spatially correlated
data involving different representations of geographic relationships, we show that the power of the Mantel test is
always lower than that of distance-based Moran’s eigenvector map (dbMEM) analysis and that the Mantel R 2 is
always smaller than in dbMEM analysis, and uninterpretable. These simulation results are novel contributions
to the Mantel debate. We also show that regression on a geographic distance matrix does not remove the spatial
structure from response data and does not produce spatially uncorrelated residuals.

4. Our main conclusion is that Mantel tests should be restricted to questions that, in the domain of application,
only concern dissimilarity matrices, and are not derived from questions that can be formulated as the analysis of
the vectors and matrices from which one can compute dissimilarity matrices.","Mantel test, spatial analysis, spatial modeling, correlational studies, "
Bender2011,"Language independence is commonly presented as one of the advantages
of modern, machine-learning approaches to NLP, and it is an important
type of scalability. If technology developed for one language can be
ported to another merely by amassing appropriate training data in
the second language, then the effort put into the development of the
technology in the first language can be leveraged to more effciently
create technology for other languages. In cases where the collection
of training data represents minimal effort (compared to the algorithm
development), this can be very efficient indeed.","language independance, NLP, Bender rule"
Bender2019,"Progress in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) depends on the existence of language
resources: digitized collections of written, spoken or signed language, often with gold standard labels or
annotations reflecting the intended output of the NLP system for the task at hand (e.g. the gold standard text
for a speech recognition system or gold standard user intent labels in a dialogue system such as Siri, Alexa
or Google Home). Unsupervised, weakly supervised, semi-supervised, or distantly supervised machine
learning techniques reduce the overall dependence on labeled data, but even with such approaches, there is
a need for both sufficient labeled data to evaluate system performance and typically much larger collections
of unlabeled data to support the very data-hungry machine learning techniques.","Bender rule, NLP, critic"
Dabrowska2019,"Universal Grammar (UG) is a suspect concept. There is little agreement on what exactly is
in it; and the empirical evidence for it is very weak. This paper critically examines a variety
of arguments that have been put forward as evidence for UG, focussing on the three
most powerful ones: universality (all human languages share a number of properties),
convergence (all language learners converge on the same grammar in spite of the fact
that they are exposed to different input), and poverty of the stimulus (children know
things about language which they could not have learned from the input available to
them). I argue that these arguments are based on premises which are either false or
unsubstantiated. Languages differ from each other in profound ways, and there are
very few true universals, so the fundamental crosslinguistic fact that needs explaining
is diversity, not universality. A number of recent studies have demonstrated the existence
of considerable differences in adult native speakers’ knowledge of the grammar of
their language, including aspects of inflectional morphology, passives, quantifiers, and
a variety of more complex constructions, so learners do not in fact converge on the
same grammar. Finally, the poverty of the stimulus argument presupposes that children
acquire linguistic representations of the kind postulated by generative grammarians;
constructionist grammars such as those proposed by Tomasello, Goldberg and others
can be learned from the input. We are the only species that has language, so there must
be something unique about humans that makes language learning possible. The extent
of crosslinguistic diversity and the considerable individual differences in the rate, style and
outcome of acquisition suggest that it is more promising to think in terms of a language-
making capacity, i.e., a set of domain-general abilities, rather than an innate body of
knowledge about the structural properties of the target system.","universal grammar, UG, critic, Chomsky syntax, "

Serva2008,"The evolution of languages closely resembles the evolution of haploid organisms. This
similarity has been recently exploited (Gray R. D. and Atkinson Q. D., Nature, 426 (2003)
435; Gray R. D. and Jordan F. M., Nature, 405 (2000) 1052) to construct language trees. The
key point is the definition of a distance among all pairs of languages which is the analogous of a
genetic distance. Many methods have been proposed to define these distances; one of these, used
by glottochronology, computes the distance from the percentage of shared “cognates”. Cognates
are words inferred to have a common historical origin, and subjective judgment plays a relevant
role in the identification process. Here we push closer the analogy with evolutionary biology and
we introduce a genetic distance among language pairs by considering a renormalized Levenshtein
distance among words with same meaning and averaging on all words contained in a Swadesh list
(Swadesh M., Proc. Am. Philos. Soc., 96 (1952) 452). The subjectivity of process is consistently
reduced and the reproducibility is highly facilitated. We test our method against the Indo-
European group considering fifty different languages and the two hundred words of the Swadesh
list for any of them. We find out a tree which closely resembles the one published in Gray and
Atkinson (2003), with some significant differences.","phylogeny, Indo-European, edit distance, Levenshtein distance, "

Vulic2019,"Recent efforts in cross-lingual word embed-
ding (CLWE) learning have predominantly fo-
cused on fully unsupervised approaches that
project monolingual embeddings into a shared
cross-lingual space without any cross-lingual
signal. The lack of any supervision makes
such approaches conceptually attractive. Yet,
their only core difference from (weakly) super-
vised projection-based CLWE methods is in
the way they obtain a seed dictionary used to
initialize an iterative self-learning procedure.
The fully unsupervised methods have arguably
become more robust, and their primary use
case is CLWE induction for pairs of resource-
poor and distant languages. In this paper, we
question the ability of even the most robust un-
supervised CLWE approaches to induce mean-
ingful CLWEs in these more challenging set-
tings. A series of bilingual lexicon induction
(BLI) experiments with 15 diverse languages
(210 language pairs) show that fully unsuper-

ber of language pairs (e.g., they yield zero BLI
performance for 87/210 pairs). Even when
they succeed, they never surpass the perfor-
mance of weakly supervised methods (seeded
with 500-1,000 translation pairs) using the
same self-learning procedure in any BLI setup,

Gao2017,"The study of language contact epitomizes the dynamics of language as a system of human commu-
nication. The competing linguistic forces at work when speakers of different language varieties
come into contact can be narrowed down to two basic concepts––convergence and divergence.
Looking at linguistic areas using a macro approach, languages in contact tend to show conver-
gence across all structural levels through diffusion and borrowing, but nevertheless, linguistic
diversity persists in regions of high interethnic language contact. Ethnicity often plays a signifi-
cant role in constructing identity, therefore a speaker’s linguistic choices can reflect ethnic identity
and intergroup relations. Because these processes occur in and as a result of complex societies,
“studies of interethnic language contact must begin by understanding the context in which speak-
ers in a community construct their own ethnicity, as well as the ideologies that affect how they
view other groups” (Fought 2013: 395). Southwest China is a particularly interesting region for
language contact research because high levels of ethnolinguistic diversity in remote areas perpet-
uates traditional interethnic contact relations while these same groups are also currently under
social and economic pressure to assimilate to mainstream Chinese society.","South-East Asia, language contact, dataset, wordlist"
Rudnicka2019,"Though the interest in use of wordnets for lexicography is (gradually) growing, no
research has been conducted so far on equivalence between lexical units (or senses)

sense-linking between plWordNet and Princeton WordNet. The proposed procedure
employs a continuum of three equivalence types: strong, regular and weak, distin-
guished by a custom-designed set of formal, semantic and translational features. To
validate the procedure, three independent samples of 120 sense pairs were manual-
ly analysed with respect to the features. The results show that synsets from the two
wordnets linked by interlingual synonymy relation have a greater number of equiva-
lents than those linked through interlingual partial synonymy or interlingual hyp-
onymy relations. Even synsets linked via interlingual synonymy may have pairs of
lexical units which are only weak equivalents. More-fine grained sense linking
enhances the usefulness of the mapped wordnets as a bilingual lexicon for transla-
tors or researchers.","wordnet, sense equivalence, meaning, NLP"
Pasternak2019,"Certain measurement-related constructions impose a requirement that the measure
function used track the part-whole structure of the domain of measurement, so that a
given entity or eventuality must have a larger measurement in the chosen dimension
than any of its salient proper parts. I provide evidence from English and Chinese that
these constructions can be used to measure the intensity of mental states like hatred and
love, indicating that in the natural language ontology of such states, intensity correlates
with part-whole structure. A natural language metaphysics of psychological intensity
meeting this requirement is then developed and integrated into the semantics. Further
complications arise when looking at attitudes like want, wish, and regret, which also
permit measurements of intensity in the relevant constructions. To account for such
attitudes, the ontology and semantics are then enriched in a way that integrates ordering
and quantification over possible worlds into the part-whole structure of attitude states,
so that even in these more complicated cases, the constructions at hand have a unified
compositional semantics.","meaning, sense, emotion, Chinese, English, particular linguistics"
Franco2019,"

The use of loanwords is generally attributed to a social feature, like social prestige, and to semantic features, like the need to fill a lexical gap. However, few studies take into account variation in the use of loanwords within a speech community, and directly compare the frequency of loanwords from more than one source language. This paper contributes to research on lexical borrowing by comparing the distribution of loanwords from three different source languages in two large databases of dialect data. We take an onomasiological perspective, which allows us to gauge the frequency of borrowed lexical items vis-à-vis alternative expressions. Using Generalized Additive Mixed Modeling, we show that the usage of loanwords can only be explained by taking into account the interaction between semantics and geographical diffusion. Our analysis confirms that the patterns that occur almost exclusively reflect changes in socio-cultural history.

Torner2019,"The digital turn in lexicography has paved the way to new techniques for presenting

used as a means of identifying collocations in large corpora, must now be rethought
in order to assist non-expert dictionary users in text production by allowing them to
find the exact collocates they are looking for, as well as by offering the grammatical
information needed to use collocations accurately. We advocate improving net-
works by incorporating information visualization techniques (Ware 2008, Pham

simplify access to the information provided by raw output from corpora —much of
which may be noise for the dictionary user— and to enrich such collocational data
by means of visually-explained relevant grammatical information.","digital turn, digital humanities, dictionary, visualization, interactive visualization, graph, network"

Kolly2016,"Which acoustic cues can be used by listeners to identify speakers’ linguistic origins in foreign-accented
speech? We investigated accent identification performance in signal-manipulated speech, where (a) Swiss
German listeners heard native German speech to which we transplanted segment durations of French-
accented German and English-accented German, and (b) Swiss German listeners heard 6-band noise-
vocoded French-accented and English-accented German speech to which we transplanted native German
segment durations. Therefore, the foreign accent cues in the stimuli consisted of only temporal informa-
tion (in a) and only strongly degraded spectral information (in b). Findings suggest that listeners were
able to identify the linguistic origin of French and English speakers in their foreign-accented German
speech based on temporal features alone, as well as based on strongly degraded spectral features alone.
When comparing these results to previous research, we found an additive trend of temporal and spectral
cues: identification performance tended to be higher when both cues were present in the signal. Acoustic
measures of temporal variability could not easily explain the perceptual results. However, listeners were
drawn towards some of the native German segmental cues in condition (a), which biased responses to-
wards ‘French’ when stimuli featured uvular /r/s and towards ‘English’ when they contained vocalized
